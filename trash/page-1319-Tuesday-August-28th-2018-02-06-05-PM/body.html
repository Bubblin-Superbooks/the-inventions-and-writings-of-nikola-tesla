<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The base B has a projection, P, which supports the brush-holders and the regulating devices, which are of a special character devised by Mr. Tesla.</p><p>The armature is constructed with the view to reduce to a minimum the loss of power due to Foucault currents and to the change of polarity, and also to shorten as much as possible the length of the inactive wire wound upon the armature core.</p><p>It is well known that when the armature is revolved between the poles of the field-magnets, currents are generated in the iron body of the armature which develop heat, and consequently cause a waste of power. Owing to the mutual action of the lines of force, the magnetic properties of iron, and the speed of the different portions of the armature core, these currents are generated principally on and near the surface of the armature core, diminishing in strength gradually toward the centre of the core.</p></div> </div>
