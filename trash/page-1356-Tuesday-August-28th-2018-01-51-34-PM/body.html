<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In pulling down the armature lever L the main magnet is assisted by the shunt-magnet N, the latter being magnetized by magnetic induction from the magnet M.</p><p>It will be seen that the armatures L and g are practically the keepers for the magnets M and N, and owing to this fact both magnets with either one of the armatures L and g may be considered as one horseshoe magnet, which we might term a "compound magnet." The whole of the soft-iron parts M, m', g, n', N and L form a compound magnet.</p><p>The carbons being separated, the fine wire receives a portion of the current. Now, the magnetic induction from the magnet M is such as to produce opposite poles on the corresponding ends of the magnet N; but the current traversing the helices tends to produce similar poles on the corresponding ends of both magnets, and therefore as soon as the fine wire is traversed by sufficient current the magnetism of the whole compound magnet is diminished.</p></div> </div>
