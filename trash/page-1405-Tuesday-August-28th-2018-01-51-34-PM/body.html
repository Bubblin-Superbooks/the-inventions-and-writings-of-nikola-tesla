The discs were arranged longitudinally to afford an easier starting by reason of the induced current formed in the iron discs, which differed in phase from those in the copper. This armature would start with a single circuit and run in synchronism, and represents one of the earliest types of such an armature. Fig. 305 is another striking exhibit. This is one of the earliest types of an armature with holes beneath the periphery, in which copper conductors are imbedded. The armature has eight closed circuits and was used in many different ways. Fig. 304 is a type of synchronous armature consisting of a block of soft steel wound with a coil closed upon itself. This armature was used in connection with the field shown in Fig. 298 and gave excellent results.</p></div> </div>
