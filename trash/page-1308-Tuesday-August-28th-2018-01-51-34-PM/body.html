<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This invention of Mr. Tesla is an improvement in the construction of dynamo or magneto electric machines or motors, consisting in a novel form of frame and field magnet which renders the machine more solid and compact as a structure, which requires fewer parts, and which involves less trouble and expense in its manufacture. It is applicable to generators and motors generally, not only to those which have independent circuits adapted for use in the Tesla alternating current system, but to other continuous or alternating current machines of the ordinary type generally used.</p><p>Fig. 268 shows the machine in side elevation. Fig. 269 is a vertical sectional view of the field magnets and frame and an end view of the armature; and Fig. 270 is a plan view of one of the parts of the frame and the armature, a portion of the latter being cut away.</p></div> </div>
