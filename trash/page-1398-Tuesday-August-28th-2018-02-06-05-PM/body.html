<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This is one of the first models used by Mr. Tesla as an induction motor and rotating transformer. The armature was either a steel or wrought iron disc with a closed coil. When the motor was operated from a two phase generator the windings were connected in two groups, as usual. When used as an induction motor, the current induced in one of the windings of the ring was passed through the other winding on the ring and so the motor operated with only two wires. When used as a transformer the outer winding served, for instance, as a secondary and the inner as a primary. The model shown at D is one of the earliest rotating field motors, consisting of a thin iron ring wound with two sets of coils and an armature consisting of a series of steel discs partly cut away and arranged on a small arbor.</p></div> </div>
