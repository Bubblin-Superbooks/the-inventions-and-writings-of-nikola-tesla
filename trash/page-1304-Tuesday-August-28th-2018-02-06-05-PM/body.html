<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The piston L of the dash-pot is provided with a valve, V, which opens by a downward pressure and allows an easy downward movement of the iron core I, but closes and checks the movement of the core when it is pulled up by the action of the solenoid.</p><p>To balance the opposing forces, the weight of the moving parts, and the pull exerted by the solenoid upon the iron core, the weights W W may be used. The adjustment is such that when the solenoid is traversed by the normal current it is just strong enough to balance the downward pull of the parts.</p><p>Fig. 266.Fig. 267.</p></div> </div>
