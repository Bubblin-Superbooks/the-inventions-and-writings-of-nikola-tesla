<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The iron core I has a screw, s, by means of which it can be raised and adjusted in its position relatively to the solenoid, so that the pull exerted upon it by the solenoid is practically uniform through the whole length of motion which is required to effect the regulation. In order to effect the adjustment with greater precision, the core I is provided with a small iron screw, s'. The core being first brought very nearly in the required position relatively to the solenoid by means of the screw s, the small screw s' is then adjusted until the magnetic attraction upon the core is the same when the core is in any position. A convenient stop, t, serves to limit the upward movement of the iron core.</p><p>To check somewhat the movement of the core I, a dash-pot, K, is used.</p></div> </div>
