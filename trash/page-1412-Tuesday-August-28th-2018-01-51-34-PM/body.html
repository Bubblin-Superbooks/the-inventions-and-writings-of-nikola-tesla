<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>All these models shown represent early work, and the enlarged engravings are made from photographs taken early in 1888. There is a great number of other models which were exhibited, but which are not brought out sharply in the engraving, Fig. 297. For example at M is a model of a motor comprising an armature with a hollow shaft wound with two or three coils for two or three-phase circuits; the armature was arranged to be stationary and the generating circuits were connected directly to the generator. Around the armature is arranged to rotate on its shaft a casting forming six closed circuits. On the outside this casting was turned smooth and the belt was placed on it for driving with any desired appliance. This also is a very early model.</p></div> </div>
