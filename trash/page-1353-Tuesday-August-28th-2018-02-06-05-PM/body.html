A manual switch, for short-circuiting the lamp when the carbons are renewed, is also fastened to the base. This switch is of ordinary character, and is not shown in the drawings.</p><p>The rod R is electrically connected to the lamp-frame by means of a flexible conductor or otherwise. The lamp-case receives a removable cover, s2, to inclose the parts.</p><p>The electrical connections are as indicated diagrammatically in Fig. 289. The wire in the main magnet consists of two parts, x' and p'. These two parts may be in two separated coils or in one single helix, as shown in the drawings. The part x' being normally in circuit, is, with the fine wire upon the shunt-magnet, wound and traversed by the current in the same direction, so as to tend to produce similar poles, N N or S S, on the corresponding pole-pieces of the magnets M and N.</p></div> </div>
