The adjustment is effected by means of a spring and screw or tightener.</p><p>In Fig. 257 instead of a solenoid, an iron tube inclosing a coil is shown. The piston of the coil is attached to both brush-holders A A and C. When the brushes are moved directly by electrical devices, as shown in Figs. 256 and 257, these are so constructed that the force exerted for adjusting is practically uniform through the whole length of motion.</p><p>Fig. 255.</p><p>It is true that auxiliary brushes have been used in connection with the helices of the field-wire; but in these instances the helices receive the entire current through the auxiliary brush or brushes, and these brushes could not be taken off without breaking the circuit through the field. These brushes cause, moreover, heavy sparking at the commutator.</p></div> </div>
