<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With regard to the armature g and the operation of the lamp, the pole m' may be considered as the "clamping" and the pole n' as the "releasing" pole.</p><p>As the carbons burn away, the fine wire receives more current and the magnetism diminishes in proportion. This causes the armature lever L to swing and the armature g to descend gradually under the weight of the moving parts until the end p, Fig. 283, strikes a stop on the top plate, B. The adjustment is such that when this takes place the rod R is yet gripped securely by the jaws e e. The further downward movement of the armature lever being prevented, the arc becomes longer as the carbons are consumed, and the compound magnet is weakened more and more until the clamping armature g releases the hold of the gripping-jaws e e upon the rod R, and the rod is allowed to drop a little, thus shortening the arc.</p></div> </div>
