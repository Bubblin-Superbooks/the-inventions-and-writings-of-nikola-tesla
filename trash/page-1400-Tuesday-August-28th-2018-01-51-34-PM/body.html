<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Another interesting exhibit, shown at G, is an early model of a two field motor energized by currents of different phase. There are two independent fields of laminated iron joined by brass bolts; in each field is mounted an armature, both armatures being on the same shaft. The armatures were originally so arranged as to be placed in any position relatively to each other, and the fields also were arranged to be connected in a number of ways. The motor has served for the exhibition of a number of features; among other things, it has been used as a dynamo for the production of currents of any frequency between wide limits. In this case the field, instead of being energized by direct current, was energized by currents differing in phase, which produced a rotation of the field; the armature was then rotated in the same or in opposite direction to the movement of the field;</p></div> </div>
