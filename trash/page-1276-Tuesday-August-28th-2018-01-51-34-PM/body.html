<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>An interesting method devised by Mr. Tesla for the regulation of direct current dynamos, is that which has come to be known as the "third brush" method. In machines of this type, devised by him as far back as 1885, he makes use of two main brushes to which the ends of the field magnet coils are connected, an auxiliary brush, and a branch or shunt connection from an intermediate point of the field wire to the auxiliary brush.</p><p>The relative positions of the respective brushes are varied, either automatically or by hand, so that the shunt becomes inoperative when the auxiliary brush has a certain position upon the commutator; but when the auxiliary brush is moved in its relation to the main brushes, or the latter are moved in their relation to the auxiliary brush, the electric condition is disturbed and more or less of the current through the field-helices is diverted through the shunt or a current is passed over the shunt to the field-helices.</p></div> </div>
