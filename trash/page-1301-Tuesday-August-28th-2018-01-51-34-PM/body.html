<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The axis of the brush-holder B is supported by two pivot-screws, p p. The other brush-holder, B', has a sleeve, d, and is movable around the axis of the brush-holder B. In this way both brush-holders can turn very freely, the friction of the parts being reduced to a minimum. Over the brush-holders is mounted the solenoid S, which rests upon a forked column, c. This column also affords a support for the pivots p p, and is fastened upon a solid bracket or projection, P, which extends from the base of the machine, and is cast in one piece with the same. The brush-holders B B' are connected by means of the links e e and the cross-piece F to the iron core I, which slides freely in the tube T of the solenoid.</p></div> </div>
