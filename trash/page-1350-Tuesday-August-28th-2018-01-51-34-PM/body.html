<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The magnets M and N are made very flat, so that their width exceeds three times their thickness, or even more. In this way a comparatively small number of convolutions is sufficient to produce the required magnetism, while a greater surface is offered for cooling off the wires.</p><p>The upper pole pieces, m n, of the magnets are curved, as indicated in the drawings, Fig. 283. The lower pole pieces m' n', are brought near together, tapering toward the armature g, as shown in Figs. 284 and 286. The object of this taper is to concentrate the greatest amount of the developed magnetism upon the armature, and also to allow the pull to be exerted always upon the middle of the armature g. This armature g is a piece of iron in the shape of a hollow cylinder, having on each side a segment cut away, the width of which is equal to the width of the pole pieces m' n'.</p></div> </div>
