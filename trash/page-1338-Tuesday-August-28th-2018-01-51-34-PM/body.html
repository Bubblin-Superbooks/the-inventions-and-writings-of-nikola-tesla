<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>M is a helix of coarse wire in a circuit from the lower carbon holder to the negative binding screw &minus;. N is a helix of fine wire in a shunt between the positive binding screw + and the negative binding screw &minus;. The upper carbon holder S is a parallel rod sliding through the plates S' S2 of the frame of the lamp, and hence the electric current passes from the positive binding post + through the plate S2, carbon holder S, and upper carbon to the lower carbon, and thence by the holder and a metallic connection to the helix M.</p><p>The carbon holders are of the usual character, and to insure electric connections the springs l are made use of to grasp the upper carbon holding rod S, but to allow the rod to slide freely through the same.</p></div> </div>
