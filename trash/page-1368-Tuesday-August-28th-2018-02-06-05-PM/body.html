<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In order to form a frame with two fields of force, a support, A, is cast with two pole pieces B B' integral with it. To this are joined by bolts E a casting D, with two similar and corresponding pole pieces C C'. The pole pieces B B' are wound and connected to produce a field of force of given polarity, and the pole pieces C C' are wound so as to produce a field of opposite polarity. The driving shafts F G pass through the poles and are journaled in insulating bearings in the casting A D, as shown.</p><p>H K are the discs or generating conductors. They are composed of copper, brass, or iron and are keyed or secured to their respective shafts. They are provided with broad peripheral flanges J. It is of course obvious that the discs may be insulated from their shafts, if so desired.</p></div> </div>
