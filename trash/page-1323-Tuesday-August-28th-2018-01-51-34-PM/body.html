<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The iron discs D D D are insulated or coated with some insulating-paint, a very careful insulation being unnecessary, as an electrical contact between several discs can only occur at places where the generated currents are comparatively weak. An armature core constructed in the manner described may be revolved between the poles of the field magnets without showing the slightest increase of temperature.</p><p>The end discs, d d, which are of sufficient thickness and, for the sake of cheapness, of cast-iron, are curved inwardly, as indicated in the drawings. The extent of the curve is dependent on the amount of wire to be wound upon the armatures. In this machine the wire is wound upon the armature in two superimposed parts, and the curve of the end discs, d d, is so calculated that the first part&mdash;that is, practically half of the wire&mdash;just fills up the hollow space to the line x x;</p></div> </div>
