<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The field magnets and frame are cast in two parts. These parts are identical in size and shape, and each consists of the solid plates or ends A B, from which project inwardly the cores C D and the side bars or bridge pieces, E F. The precise shape of these parts is largely a matter of choice&mdash;that is to say, each casting, as shown, forms an approximately rectangular frame; but it might obviously be more or less oval, round, or square, without departure from the invention. It is also desirable to reduce the width of the side bars, E F, at the center and to so proportion the parts that when the frame is put together the spaces between the pole pieces will be practically equal to the arcs which the surfaces of the poles occupy.</p></div> </div>
