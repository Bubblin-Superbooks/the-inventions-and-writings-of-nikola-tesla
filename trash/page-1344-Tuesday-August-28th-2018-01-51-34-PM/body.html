The segmental armature pieces r are shown as nearly semicircular. They are square or of any other desired shape, the ends of the pole pieces M3, N3 being made to correspond in shape.</p><p>In a modification of this lamp, Mr. Tesla provided means for automatically withdrawing a lamp from the circuit, or cutting it out when, from a failure of the feed, the arc reached an abnormal length; and also means for automatically reinserting such lamp in the circuit when the rod drops and the carbons come into contact.</p></div> </div>
