<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Another interesting class of apparatus to which Mr. Tesla has directed his attention, is that of "unipolar" generators, in which a disc or a cylindrical conductor is mounted between magnetic poles adapted to produce an approximately uniform field. In the disc armature machines the currents induced in the rotating conductor flow from the centre to the periphery, or conversely, according to the direction of rotation or the lines of force as determined by the signs of the magnetic poles, and these currents are taken off usually by connections or brushes applied to the disc at points on its periphery and near its centre. In the case of the cylindrical armature machine, the currents developed in the cylinder are taken off by brushes applied to the sides of the cylinder at its ends.</p></div> </div>
