<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The collector is made in the same form as the commutator. It is composed of the two metallic segments E E' and the two insulating segments F F', bound together by a band, C. The metallic segments E E' are of the same or practically the same width or extent as the insulating segments or spaces of the commutator. The collector is secured to a sleeve, B', by screws g g, and the sleeve is arranged to turn freely on the shaft A. The end of the sleeve B' is closed by a plate, f, upon which presses a pivot-pointed screw, h, adjustable in a spring, H, which acts to maintain the collector in close contact with the commutator and to compensate for the play of the shaft. The collector is so fixed that it cannot turn with the shaft.</p></div> </div>
