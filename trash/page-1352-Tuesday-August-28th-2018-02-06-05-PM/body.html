<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The bearings w w are carried by a lever, t, one end of which rests upon an adjustable support, q, of the side columns, S, the other end being connected by means of the link e' to the armature-lever L. The armature-lever L is a flat piece of iron in N shape, having its ends curved so as to correspond to the form of the upper pole-pieces of the magnets M and N. It is hung upon the pivots v v, Fig. 284, which are in the jaw x of the top plate B. This plate B, with the jaw, is cast in one piece and screwed to the side columns, S S, that extend up from the base A. To partly balance the overweight of the moving parts, a spring, s', Figs. 284 and 288, is fastened to the top plate, B, and hooked to the lever t. The hook o is toward one side of the lever or bent a little sidewise, as seen in Fig. 288. By this means a slight tendency is given to swing the armature toward the pole-piece m' of the main magnet.</p></div> </div>
