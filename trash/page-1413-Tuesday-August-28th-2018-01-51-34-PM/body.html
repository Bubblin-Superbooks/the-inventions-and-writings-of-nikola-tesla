Each of these models involves some distinct idea and they all represent gradual development chiefly interesting as showing Mr. Tesla's efforts to adapt his system to the existing high frequencies.</p><p>On the right side of the table, at S, T, are shown, on separate supports, larger and more perfected armatures of commercial motors, and in the space around the table a variety of motors and generators supplying currents to them was exhibited.</p><p>The high frequency exhibit embraced Mr. Tesla's first original apparatus used in his investigations. There was exhibited a glass tube with one layer of silk-covered wire wound at the top and a copper ribbon on the inside. This was the first disruptive discharge coil constructed by him.</p></div> </div>
