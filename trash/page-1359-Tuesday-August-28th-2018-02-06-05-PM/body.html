<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It occurs often in practical work that the rod sticks in the guides. In this case the are reaches a great length, until it finally breaks. Then the light goes out, and frequently the fine wire is injured. To prevent such an accident Mr. Tesla provides this lamp with an automatic cut-out which operates as follows: When, upon a failure of the feed, the arc reaches a certain predetermined length, such an amount of current is diverted through the fine wire that the polarity of the compound magnet is reversed. The clamping armature g is now moved against the shunt magnet N until it strikes the releasing pole n'. As soon as the contact is established, the current passes from the positive binding post over the clamp r, armature g, insulated shunt magnet, and the helix p' upon the main magnet M to the negative binding post.</p></div> </div>
