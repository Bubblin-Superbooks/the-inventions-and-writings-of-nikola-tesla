<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> At both ends of the armature the inwardly curved discs d d, of cast iron, are fastened to the armature shaft.</p><p>The armature core being constructed as shown, it will be easily seen that on those portions of the armature that are the most remote from the axis, and where the currents are principally developed, the length of iron in the generating direction is only a small fraction of the total length of the armature core, and besides this the iron body is subdivided in the generating direction, and therefore the Foucault currents are greatly reduced. Another cause of heating is the shifting of the poles of the armature core. In consequence of the subdivision of the iron in the armature and the increased surface for radiation, the risk of heating is lessened.</p></div> </div>
