<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This armature was used to reduce the speed of the motor with reference to that of the generator. Fig. 300 is still another armature with a great number of independent circuits closed upon themselves, so that all the dead points on the armature are done away with, and the armature has a large starting torque. Fig. 303 is another type of armature for a four-pole motor but with coils wound upon a smooth surface. A number of these armatures have hollow shafts, as they have been used in many ways. Figs. 309 and 310 represent armatures to which either alternating or direct current was conveyed by means of sliding rings. Fig. 309 consists of a soft iron body with a single coil wound around it, the ends of the coil being connected to two sliding rings to which, usually, direct current was conveyed. The armature shown in Fig. 310 has three insulated rings on a shaft and was used in connection with two or three phase circuits.</p></div> </div>
