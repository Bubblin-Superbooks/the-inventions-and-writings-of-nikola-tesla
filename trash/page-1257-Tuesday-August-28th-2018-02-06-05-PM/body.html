<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In direct current dynamos of great electromotive force&mdash;such, for instance, as those used for arc lighting&mdash;when one commutator bar or plate comes out of contact with the collecting-brush a spark is apt to appear on the commutator. This spark may be due to the break of the complete circuit, or to a shunt of low resistance formed by the brush between two or more commutator-bars. In the first case the spark is more apparent, as there is at the moment when the circuit is broken a discharge of the magnets through the field helices, producing a great spark or flash which causes an unsteady current, rapid wear of the commutator bars and brushes, and waste of power. The sparking may be reduced by various devices, such as providing a path for the current at the moment when the commutator segment or bar leaves the brush, by short-circuiting the field-helices, by increasing the number of the commutator-bars, or by other similar means; but all these devices are expensive or not fully available, and seldom attain the object desired.</p></div> </div>
