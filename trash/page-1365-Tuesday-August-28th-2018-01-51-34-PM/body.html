<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The same principle is involved in the case of both forms of machine above described, but the description now given is confined to the disc type, which Mr. Tesla is inclined to favor for that machine. The discs are formed with flanges, after the manner of pulleys, and are connected together by flexible conducting bands or belts.</p><p>The machine is built in such manner that the direction of magnetism or order of the poles in one field of force is opposite to that in the other, so that rotation of the discs in the same direction develops a current in one from centre to circumference and in the other from circumference to centre. Contacts applied therefore to the shafts upon which the discs are mounted form the terminals of a circuit the electro-motive force in which is the sum of the electro-motive forces of the two discs.</p></div> </div>
