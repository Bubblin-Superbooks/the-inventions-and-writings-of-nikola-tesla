<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The field helices may be connected, as shown in Fig. 259, or a part of the field helices may be in the outgoing and the other part in the return circuit, and two auxiliary brushes may be employed as shown in Figs. 261 and 262. Instead of shunting the whole of the field helices, a portion only of such helices may be shunted, as shown in Figs. 260 and 262.</p><p>The arrangement shown in Fig. 262 is advantageous, as it diminishes the sparking upon the commutator, the main circuit being closed through the auxiliary brushes at the moment of the break of the circuit at the main brushes.</p><p>Fig. 259.</p><p>Fig. 260.</p></div> </div>
