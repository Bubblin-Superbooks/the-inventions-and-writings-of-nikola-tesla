<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The armature is soldered or otherwise fastened to the clamp r, which is formed of a brass tube, provided with gripping-jaws e e, Fig. 287. These jaws are arcs of a circle of the diameter of the rod R, and are made of hardened German silver. The guides f f, through which the carbon-holding rod R slides, are made of the same material. This has the advantage of reducing greatly the wear and corrosion of the parts coming in frictional contact with the rod, which frequently causes trouble. The jaws e e are fastened to the inside of the tube r, so that one is a little lower than the other. The object of this is to provide a greater opening for the passage of the rod when the same is released by the clamp. The clamp r is supported on bearings w w, Figs. 283, 285 and 287, which are just in the middle between the jaws e e.</p></div> </div>
