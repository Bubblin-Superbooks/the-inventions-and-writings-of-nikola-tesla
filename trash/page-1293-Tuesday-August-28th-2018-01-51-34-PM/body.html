In the latter two cases, it will be understood, the motion of the main brushes relatively to the neutral line of the machine causes variations in the strength of the current independently of their relative position to the auxiliary brush. In all cases the adjustment may be such that when the machine is running with the ordinary load, no current flows over the auxiliary brush.</p></div> </div>
