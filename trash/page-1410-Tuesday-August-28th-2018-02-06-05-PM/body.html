There is another very small coil at right angles to the first. This small coil was used for the purpose of increasing the starting torque and was found very effective in this connection. Figs. 306 and 308 show a favorite construction of armature; the iron body is made up of two sets of discs cut away and placed at right angles to each other, the interstices being wound with coils. The one shown in Fig. 308 is provided with an additional groove on each of the projections formed by the discs, for the purpose of increasing the starting torque by a wire wound in these projections. Fig. 307 is a form of armature similarly constructed, but with four independent coils wound upon the four projections.</p></div> </div>
