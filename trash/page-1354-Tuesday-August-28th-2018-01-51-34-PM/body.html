<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The part p' is only in circuit when the lamp is cut out, and then the current being in the opposite direction produces in the main magnet, magnetism of the opposite polarity.</p><p>The operation is as follows: At the start the carbons are to be in contact, and the current passes from the positive binding-post K to the lamp-frame, carbon-holder, upper and lower carbon, insulated return-wire in one of the side rods, and from there through the part x' of the wire on the main magnet to the negative binding-post. Upon the passage of the current the main magnet is energized and attracts the clamping-armature g, swinging the clamp and gripping the rod by means of the gripping jaws e e. At the same time the armature lever L is pulled down and the carbons are separated.</p></div> </div>
