<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At E is shown one of the first rotating field or induction motors used for the regulation of an arc lamp and for other purposes. It comprises a ring of discs with two sets of coils having different self-inductions, one set being of German silver and the other of copper wire. The armature is wound with two closed-circuited coils at right angles to each other. To the armature shaft are fastened levers and other devices to effect the regulation. At F is shown a model of a magnetic lag motor; this embodies a casting with pole projections protruding from two coils between which is arranged to rotate a smooth iron body. When an alternating current is sent through the two coils the pole projections of the field and armature within it are similarly magnetized, and upon the cessation or reversal of the current the armature and field repel each other and rotation is produced in this way.</p></div> </div>
