It will be understood, of course, that the rotation and action of the commutator must be in synchronism or in proper accord with the periods of the alternations in order to secure the desired results. Such a disposition is represented diagrammatically in Fig. 222. Corresponding to the previous figures, A is the generator of alternating currents, B B the line, and C D the two branches for the direct currents.</p></div> </div>
