<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The primary P P is wound in two parts, and oppositely, upon a wooden spool w, and the four ends are led out of the oil through hard rubber tubes t t. The ends of the secondary T1 T1, are also led out of the oil through rubber tubes t1 t1 of great thickness. The primary and secondary layers are insulated by cotton cloth, the thickness of the insulation, of course, bearing some proportion to the difference of potential between the turns of the different layers. Each half of the primary has four layers, 24 turns in each, this giving a total of 96 turns. When both the parts are connected in series, this gives a ratio of conversion of about 1:2.7, and with the primaries in multiple, 1:5.4; but in operating with very rapidly alternating currents this ratio does not convey even an approximate idea of the ratio of the e. m. f's. in the primary and secondary circuits.</p></div> </div>
