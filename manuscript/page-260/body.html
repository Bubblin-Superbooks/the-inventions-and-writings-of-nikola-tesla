<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 68.Fig. 69.</p><p>A designates the field-magnet or magnetic frame of the motor; B B, oppositely located pole-pieces adapted to receive the coils of one energizing circuit; and C C, similar pole-pieces for the coils of the other energizing circuit. These circuits are designated, respectively, by D E, the conductor D'' forming a common return to the generator G. Between these poles is mounted an armature&mdash;for example, a ring or annular armature, wound with a series of coils F, forming a closed circuit or circuits. The action or operation of a motor thus constructed is now well understood. It will be observed, however, that the magnetism of poles B, for example, established by a current impulse in the coils thereon, precedes the magnetic effect set up in the armature by the induced current in coils F. Consequently the mutual attraction between the armature and field-poles is considerably reduced.</p></div> </div>
