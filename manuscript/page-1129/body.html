<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The principal advantage of this type of machine is that there is not much magnetic leakage, and that a field may be produced, varying greatly in intensity in places not much distant from each other.</p><p>In these engravings, Figs. 204 and 205 illustrate a machine in which the armature conductor and field coils are stationary, while the field magnet core revolves. Fig. 206 shows a machine embodying the same plan of construction, but having a stationary field magnet and rotary armature.</p><p>The conductor in which the currents are induced may be arranged in various ways; but Mr. Tesla prefers the following method: He employs an annular plate of copper D, and by means of a saw cuts in it radial slots from one edge nearly through to the other, beginning alternately from opposite edges. In this way a continuous zigzag conductor is formed.</p></div> </div>
