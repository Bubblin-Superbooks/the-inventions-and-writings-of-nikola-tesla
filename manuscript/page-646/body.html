<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The cost is a great drawback, but if we employ an oil as an insulator the distribution of electrical energy with something like 100,000 volts, and even more, becomes, at least with higher frequencies, so easy that it could be hardly called an engineering feat. With oil insulation and alternate current motors, transmissions of power can be affected with safety and upon an industrial basis at distances of as much as a thousand miles.</p><p>A peculiar property of oils, and liquid insulation in general, when subjected to rapidly changing electric stresses, is to disperse any gaseous bubbles which may be present, and diffuse them through its mass, generally long before any injurious break can occur. This feature may be easily observed with an ordinary induction coil by taking the primary out, plugging up the end of the tube upon which the secondary is wound, and filling it with some fairly transparent insulator, such as paraffine oil.</p></div> </div>
