<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The tube was exhausted to a moderate degree and it was found that when it was attached to the terminal of a high-frequency coil the platinum wire w would indeed, become incandescent in patches, as illustrated in Fig. 187. Later a number of these tubes with one or more wires were prepared, each showing this result. The effect was best noted when the striated discharge occurred in the tube, but was also produced when the stri&aelig; were not visible, showing that, even then, the gas in the tube was not of uniform density. The position of the stri&aelig; was generally such, that the rarefactions corresponded to the places of incandescence or greater brightness on the wire w. But in a few instances it was noted, that the bright spots on the wire were covered by the dense parts of the striated discharge as indicated by l in Fig. 187, though the effect was barely perceptible.</p></div> </div>
