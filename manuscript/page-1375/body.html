<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This armature g is a piece of iron in the shape of a hollow cylinder, having on each side a segment cut away, the width of which is equal to the width of the pole pieces m' n'.</p><p>The armature is soldered or otherwise fastened to the clamp r, which is formed of a brass tube, provided with gripping-jaws e e, Fig. 287. These jaws are arcs of a circle of the diameter of the rod R, and are made of hardened German silver. The guides f f, through which the carbon-holding rod R slides, are made of the same material. This has the advantage of reducing greatly the wear and corrosion of the parts coming in frictional contact with the rod, which frequently causes trouble. The jaws e e are fastened to the inside of the tube r, so that one is a little lower than the other.</p></div> </div>
