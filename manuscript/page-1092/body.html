<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Theoretical considerations have led Mr. Tesla to the belief that these disadvantageous features could be obviated by employing currents of a sufficiently high number of alternations, and his anticipations have been confirmed in practice. These rapidly alternating currents render it possible to maintain small arcs which, besides, possess the advantages of silence and persistency. The latter quality is due to the necessarily rapid alternations, in consequence of which the arc has no time to cool, and is always maintained at a high temperature and low resistance.</p><p>At the outset of his experiments Mr. Tesla encountered great difficulties in the construction of high frequency machines. A generator of this kind is described here, which, though constructed quite some time ago, is well worthy of a detailed description. It may be mentioned, in passing, that dynamos of this type have been used by Mr. Tesla in his lighting researches and experiments with currents of high potential and high frequency, and reference to them will be found in his lectures elsewhere printed in this volume.</p></div> </div>
