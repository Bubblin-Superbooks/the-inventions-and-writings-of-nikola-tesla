<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The brilliancy of the lamp may, in this case, be regulated within wide limits by varying the size of the insulated metal plate to which the coating is connected.</p><p>It is likewise practicable to light with one leading wire lamps such as illustrated in Fig. 116 and Fig. 117, by connecting one terminal of the lamp to one terminal of the source, and the other to an insulated body of the required size. In all cases the insulated body serves to give off the energy into the surrounding space, and is equivalent to a return wire. Obviously, in the two last-named cases, instead of connecting the wires to an insulated body, connections may be made to the ground.</p></div> </div>
