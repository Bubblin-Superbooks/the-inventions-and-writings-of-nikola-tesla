At the beginning the task appeared difficult, but the experiences gathered permitted me to reach the result easily. In Fig. 163 and Fig. 164, two such tubes are illustrated, which are prepared for the occasion. In Fig. 163 a short tube T1, sealed to another long tube T, is provided with a stem s, with a platinum wire sealed in the latter. A very thin lamp filament l, is fastened to this wire and connection to the outside is made through a thin copper wire w. The tube is provided with outside and inside coatings, C and C1, respectively, and is filled as far as the coatings reach with conducting, and the space above with insulating, powder.</p></div> </div>
