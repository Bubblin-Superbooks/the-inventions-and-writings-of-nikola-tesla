The coil was operated at only a small fraction of its capacity, as the necessary condensers and transformers could not be had and as Mr. Tesla's stay was limited to one week; notwithstanding, the phenomena were of a striking character. In the room were arranged two large plates placed at a distance of about eighteen feet from each other. Between them were placed two long tables with all sorts of phosphorescent bulbs and tubes; many of these were prepared with great care and marked legibly with the names which would shine with phosphorescent glow.</p></div> </div>
