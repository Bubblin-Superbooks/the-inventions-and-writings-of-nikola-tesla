<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The following description deals with another form of motor, namely, depending on "magnetic lag" or hysteresis, its peculiarity being that in it the attractive effects or phases while lagging behind the phases of current which produce them, are manifested simultaneously and not successively. The phenomenon utilized thus at an early stage by Mr. Tesla, was not generally believed in by scientific men, and Prof. Ayrton was probably first to advocate it or to elucidate the reason of its supposed existence.</p><p>Fig. 54 is a side view of the motor, in elevation. Fig. 55 is a part-sectional view at right angles to Fig. 54. Fig. 56 is an end view in elevation and part section of a modification, and Fig. 57 is a similar view of another modification.</p></div> </div>
