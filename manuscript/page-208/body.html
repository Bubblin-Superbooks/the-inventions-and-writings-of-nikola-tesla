<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One of the general ways followed by Mr. Tesla in developing his rotary phase motors is to produce practically independent currents differing primarily in phase and to pass these through the motor-circuits. Another way is to produce a single alternating current, to divide it between the motor-circuits, and to effect artificially a lag in one of these circuits or branches, as by giving to the circuits different self-inductive capacity, and in other ways. In the former case, in which the necessary difference of phase is primarily effected in the generation of currents, in some instances, the currents are passed through the energizing coils of both elements of the motor&mdash;the field and armature; but a further result or modification may be obtained by doing this under the conditions hereinafter specified in the case of motors in which the lag, as above stated, is artificially secured.</p></div> </div>
