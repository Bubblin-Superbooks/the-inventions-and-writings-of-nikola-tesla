When the frequency is extremely high, nodes are found to exist on such a bar, and it is easy to locate them by means of a lamp.</p><p>By converting the high tension discharges of a low frequency coil in this manner, it was found practicable to keep a few lamps burning on the ordinary circuit in the laboratory, and by bringing the undulation to a low pitch, it was possible to operate small motors.</p></div> </div>
