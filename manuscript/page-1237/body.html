<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Use is made of either an electro-magnet or a permanent magnet, and the heat is directed against a body that is magnetized by induction, rather than directly against a permanent magnet, thereby avoiding the loss of magnetism that might result in the permanent magnet by the action of heat. Mr. Tesla also provides for lessening the volume of the heat or for intercepting the same during that portion of the reciprocation in which the cooling action takes place.</p><p>In the diagrams are shown some of the numerous arrangements that may be made use of in carrying out this idea. In all of these figures the magnet-poles are marked N S, the armature A, the Bunsen burner or other source of heat H, the axis of motion M, and the spring or the equivalent thereof&mdash;namely, a weight&mdash;is marked W.</p></div> </div>
