<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 224.</p><p>Referring to Fig. 224 in one of the branches, as C, are two coils M', wound on laminated cores, and in the other branches D are similar coils N'. A subdivided or laminated armature O', carrying a closed coil R', is rotatably supported between the coils M' N', as shown. In the position shown&mdash;that is, with the coil R' parallel with the convolutions of the primaries N' M'&mdash;practically the whole current will pass through branch D, because the self-induction in coils M' M' is maximum. If, therefore, the armature and coil be rotated at a proper speed relatively to the periods or alternations of the source A, the same results are obtained as in the case of Fig. 222.</p></div> </div>
