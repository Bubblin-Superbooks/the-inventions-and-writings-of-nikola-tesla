These plates are, of course, useful at those edges of the segments only where sparks are liable to occur, and, as they are easily replaced, they are of great advantage. It is considered best to coat them with platinum or silver.</p><p>In Figs. 251 and 252 is shown a construction where, instead of solid segments, a fluid is employed. In this case the commutator and collector are made of two insulating discs, S T, and in lieu of the metal segments a space is cut out of each part, as at R R', corresponding in shape and size to a metal segment. The two parts are fitted smoothly and the collector T held by the screw h and spring H against the commutator S.</p></div> </div>
