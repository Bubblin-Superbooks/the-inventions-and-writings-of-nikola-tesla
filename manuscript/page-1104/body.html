<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When the polar projections are 1/8 inch wide, the width of the conductor should not, under any circumstances, be more than 1/32 inch wide; even then the eddy effect is considerable.</p><p>To the inner edge of this plate are secured two rings of non-magnetic metal E, which are insulated from the copper conductor, but held firmly thereto by means of the bolts F. Within the rings E is then placed an annular coil G, which is the energizing coil for the field magnet. The conductor D and the parts attached thereto are supported by means of the cylindrical shell or casting A A, the two parts of which are brought together and clamped to the outer edge of the conductor D.</p></div> </div>
