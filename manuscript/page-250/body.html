<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If a current impulse be directed through the two circuits of the motor, it will quickly energize the cores B, but not so the cores C, for the reason that in passing through the coils E there is encountered the influence of the closed magnetic circuits formed by the shields H. The first effect is to retard effectively the current impulse in circuit G, while at the same time the proportion of current which does pass does not magnetize the cores C, which are shielded or screened by the shields H. As the increasing electromotive force then urges more current through the coils E, the iron wire H becomes magnetically saturated and incapable of carrying all the lines of force, and hence ceases to protect the cores C, which becomes magnetized, developing their maximum effect after an interval of time subsequent to the similar manifestation of strength in the other set of magnets, the extent of which is arbitrarily determined by the thickness of the shield H, and other well-understood conditions.</p></div> </div>
