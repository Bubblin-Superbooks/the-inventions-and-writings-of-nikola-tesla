<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>the armature which is mounted to rotate in obedience to the co-operative influence or action of the energizing circuits has coils wound upon it which are closed upon themselves and in which currents are induced by the energizing-currents with the object and result of energizing the armature-core; but under any such conditions as must exist in these motors, it is obvious that a certain time must elapse between the manifestations of an energizing current impulse in the field coils, and the corresponding magnetic state or phase in the armature established by the current induced thereby; consequently a given magnetic influence or effect in the field which is the direct result of a primary current impulse will have become more or less weakened or lost before the corresponding effect in the armature indirectly produced has reached its maximum.</p></div> </div>
