<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For instance, during a storm a stream may form on a nail or pointed projection of a building. If lightning strikes somewhere in the neighborhood, the harmless static discharge may, in consequence of the oscillations set up, assume the character of a high-frequency streamer, and the nail or projection may be brought to a high temperature by the violent impact of the air molecules. Thus, it is thought, a building may be set on fire without the lightning striking it. In like manner small metallic objects may be fused and volatilized&mdash;as frequently occurs in lightning discharges&mdash;merely because they are surrounded by air. Were they immersed in a practically continuous medium, such as oil, they would probably be safe, as the energy would have to spend itself elsewhere.</p><p>An instructive experience having a bearing on this subject is the following:&mdash;</p></div> </div>
