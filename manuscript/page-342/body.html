<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In some cases Mr. Tesla builds up the armature of annular plates K K, held by bolts L between heads M, which are secured to the driving shaft, and in the hollow space thus formed he places a condenser F, generally by winding the two insulated plates spirally around the shaft. In other cases he utilizes the plates of the core itself as the plates of the condenser. For example, in Figs. 88 and 89, N is the driving shaft, M M are the heads of the armature-core, and K K' the iron plates of which the core is built up. These plates are insulated from the shaft and from one another, and are held together by rods or bolts L. The bolts pass through a large hole in one plate and a small hole in the one next adjacent, and so on, connecting electrically all of plates K, as one armature of a condenser, and all of plates K' as the other.</p></div> </div>
