<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The bulb hangs downward from the terminal, t, the zinc sheet, Z, performing the double office of intensifier and reflector. The reflector is separated from the terminal, t, by an extension of the insulating plug, P.</p><p>A similar disposition with a phosphorescent tube is illustrated in Fig. 156. The tube, T, is prepared from two short tubes of different diameter, which are sealed on the ends. On the lower end is placed an inside conducting coating, C, which connects to the wire w. The wire has a hook on the upper end for suspension, and passes through the centre of the inside tube, which is filled with some good and tightly packed insulator. On the outside of the upper end of the tube, T, is another conducting coating, C1, upon which is slipped a metallic reflector Z, which should be separated by a thick insulation from the end of wire w.</p></div> </div>
