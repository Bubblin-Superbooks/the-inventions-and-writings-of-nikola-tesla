<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So, if the armature-coils F F' be closed through the motor, the latter will not be turned as long as the movement of the generator armature is synchronous with that of the exciter or of the magnetic poles of its field. If, on the contrary, the speed of the generator armature be in any way checked, so that the shifting or rotation of the poles of the field becomes relatively more rapid, currents will be induced in the armature coils. This obviously follows from the passing of the lines of force across the armature conductors. The greater the speed of rotation of the magnetic poles relatively to that of the armature the more rapidly the currents developed in the coils of the latter will follow one another, and the more rapidly the motor will revolve in response thereto, and this continues until the armature generator is stopped entirely, as by a brake, when the motor, if properly constructed, runs at the speed with which the magnetic poles of the generator rotate.</p></div> </div>
