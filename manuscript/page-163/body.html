<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With this generator an exciter is employed. This consists of two poles, A A, of steel permanently magnetized, or of iron excited by a battery or other generator of continuous currents, and a cylindrical armature core mounted on a shaft, B, and wound with two longitudinal coils, C C'. One end of each of these coils is connected to the collecting-rings b c, respectively, while the other ends are both connected to a ring, a. Collecting-brushes b' c' bear on the rings b c, respectively, and conductors L L convey the currents therefrom through the coils E and E of the generator. L' is a common return-wire to brush a'. Two independent circuits are thus formed, one including coils C of the exciter and E E of the generator, the other coils C' of the exciter and E' E' of the generator.</p></div> </div>
