Hence whatever tends to decrease the self-induction and increase the current in the induced circuits will, other things being equal, increase the output and efficiency of the motor, and the same will be true of causes that operate to maintain the mutual attractive effect between the field magnets and armature at its maximum. Mr. Tesla secures these results by connecting with the induced circuit or circuits a condenser, in the manner described below, and he also, with this purpose in view, constructs the motor in a special manner.</p></div> </div>
