The break occurs much quicker if the top of the bulb is drawn out into a fine fibre. In bulbs used with these coils such narrow, pointed channels must therefore be avoided.</p><p>When a conducting body is immersed in air, or similar insulating medium, consisting of, or containing, small freely movable particles capable of being electrified, and when the electrification of the body is made to undergo a very rapid change&mdash;which is equivalent to saying that the electrostatic force acting around the body is varying in intensity,&mdash;the small particles are attracted and repelled, and their violent impacts against the body may cause a mechanical motion of the latter.</p></div> </div>
