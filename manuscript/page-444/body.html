He expressed his firm conviction that by observing proper conditions, intelligence, and possibly even power, can be transmitted through the medium or through the earth; and he considers this problem worthy of serious and immediate consideration.</p><p>Coming now to the light phenomena in particular, he illustrated the four distinct kinds of these phenomena in an original way, which to many must have been a revelation. Mr. Tesla attributes these light effects to molecular or atomic impacts produced by a varying electrostatic stress in a gaseous medium. He illustrated in a series of novel experiments the effect of the gas surrounding the conductor and shows beyond a doubt that with high frequency and high potential currents, the surrounding gas is of paramount importance in the heating of the conductor.</p></div> </div>
