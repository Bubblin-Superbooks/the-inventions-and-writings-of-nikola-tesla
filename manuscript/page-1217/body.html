<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Whether the division of the currents or waves of current of opposite sign be effected with absolute precision or not is immaterial, since it will be sufficient if the waves are only partially diverted or directed, for in such case the preponderating influence in each branch of the circuit of the waves of one sign secures the same practical results in many if not all respects as though the current were direct and continuous.</p><p>An alternating and a direct current have been combined so that the waves of one direction or sign were partially or wholly overcome by the direct current; but by this plan only one set of alternations are utilized, whereas by the system just described the entire current is rendered available. By obvious applications of this discovery Mr. Tesla is enabled to produce a self-exciting alternating dynamo, or to operate direct current meters on alternating-current circuits or to run various devices&mdash;</p></div> </div>
