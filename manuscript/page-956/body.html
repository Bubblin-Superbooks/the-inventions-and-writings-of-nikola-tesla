<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It was astonishing at first to realize that a current may flow through the conducting path even if the latter be interrupted, and it was still more surprising to learn, that sometimes it may be even easier to make a current flow under such conditions than through a closed path. But that old idea is gradually disappearing, even among practical men, and will soon be entirely forgotten.</p><p>If I connect an insulated metal plate P, Fig. 175, to one of the terminals T of the induction coil by means of a wire, though this plate be very well insulated, a current passes through the wire when the coil is set to work. First I wish to give you evidence that there is a current passing through the connecting wire. An obvious way of demonstrating this is to insert between the terminal of the coil and the insulated plate a very thin platinum or german silver wire w and bring the latter to incandescence or fusion by the current.</p></div> </div>
