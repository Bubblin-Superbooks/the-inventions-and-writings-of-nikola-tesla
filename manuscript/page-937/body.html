When the coil is set to work, you see no streamers or light between the plates, yet the medium between them is under a tremendous strain. I still further augment the strain by raising the e. m. f. in the primary circuit, and soon you see the air give way and the hall is illuminated by a shower of brilliant and noisy sparks, Fig. 170b. These sparks could be produced also with unvarying force; they have been for many years a familiar phenomenon, though they were usually obtained from an entirely different apparatus. In describing these two phenomena so radically different in appearance, I have advisedly spoken of a "force" acting between the plates. It would be in accordance with accepted views to say, that there was an "alternating e. m. f," acting between the plates.</p></div> </div>
