<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Instead of subdividing the disc or cylinder spirally, as indicated in Fig. 295, it is more convenient to interpose one or more turns between the disc and the contact ring on the periphery, as illustrated in Fig. 296.</p><p>A Forbes dynamo may, for instance, be excited in such a manner. In the experience of the writer it has been found that instead of taking the current from two such discs by sliding contacts, as usual, a flexible conducting belt may be employed to advantage. The discs are in such case provided with large flanges, affording a very great contact surface. The belt should be made to bear on the flanges with spring pressure to take up the expansion. Several machines with belt contact were constructed by the writer two years ago, and worked satisfactorily; but for want of time the work in that direction has been temporarily suspended.</p></div> </div>
