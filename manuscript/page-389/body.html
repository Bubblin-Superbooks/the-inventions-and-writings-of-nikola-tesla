<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The experimenter brings his body in contact with the terminals of the secondary of the coil, or attaches to one or both terminals insulated bodies of very small bulk, such as exhausted bulbs, and he produces a considerable rise or fall of potential on the secondary, and greatly affects the flow of the current through the primary coil.</p><p>In many of the phenomena observed, the presence of the air, or, generally speaking, of a medium of a gaseous nature (using this term not to imply specific properties, but in contradistinction to homogeneity or perfect continuity) plays an important part, as it allows energy to be dissipated by molecular impact or bombardment. The action is thus explained:&mdash;When an insulated body connected to a terminal of the coil is suddenly charged to high potential, it acts inductively upon the surrounding air, or whatever gaseous medium there might be.</p></div> </div>
