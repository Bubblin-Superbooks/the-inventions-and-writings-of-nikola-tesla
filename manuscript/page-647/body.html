<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When the discharge is established under proper conditions, a luminous hollow cone is formed, and in the dark one-half of the brass sphere is strongly illuminated, as shown in the cut.</p><p>By some artifice or other it is easy to concentrate the streams upon small surfaces and to produce very strong light effects. Two thin wires may thus be rendered intensely luminous.</p><p>In order to intensify the streams the wires should be very thin and short; but as in this case their capacity would be generally too small for the coil&mdash;at least for such a one as the present&mdash;it is necessary to augment the capacity to the required value, while, at the same time, the surface of the wires remains very small. This may be done in many ways.</p></div> </div>
