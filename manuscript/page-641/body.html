They are supported on insulating cords at a distance of about thirty centimetres. I attach now to each of the terminals of the coil one of the wires, and set the coil in action. Upon turning the lights off in the room you see the wires strongly illuminated by the streams issuing abundantly from their whole surface in spite of the cotton covering, which may even be very thick.</p></div> </div>
