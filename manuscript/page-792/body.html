Here again, originally, the potential was not sufficient to excite phosphorescence until the action was intensified&mdash;in this case, however, to present a different feature, by touching the socket with a metallic object held in the hand. The electrode in the bulb was a carbon button so large that it could not be brought to incandescence, and thereby spoil the effect produced by phosphorescence.</p></div> </div>
