<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Assuming the preceding considerations to be true, then, by rapidly alternating the potential of a body immersed in an insulating gaseous medium, any amount of energy may be dissipated into space. Most of that energy then, I believe, is not dissipated in the form of long ether waves, propagated to considerable distance, as is thought most generally, but is consumed&mdash;in the case of an insulated sphere, for example&mdash;in impact and collisional losses&mdash;that is, heat vibrations&mdash;on the surface and in the vicinity of the sphere. To reduce the dissipation, it is necessary to work with a small electric density&mdash;the smaller, the higher the frequency.</p><p>But since, on the assumption before made, the loss is diminished with the square of the density, and since currents of very high frequencies involve considerable waste when transmitted through conductors, it follows that, on the whole, it is better to employ one wire than two.</p></div> </div>
