<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To start them Mr. Tesla short-circuits the synchronizing motor by a switch P', throwing the whole current through the torque motor. Then when the desired speed is reached the switch P' is opened, so that the current passes through both motors. In such an arrangement as this it is obviously desirable for economical and other reasons that a proper relation between the speeds of the two motors should be observed.</p><p>In Fig. 82 another disposition is illustrated. S is the synchronizing motor and T the torque motor, the circuits of both being in parallel. W is a circuit also in derivation to the motor circuits and containing a switch P''. S' is a switch in the synchronizing motor circuit. On the start the switch S' is opened, cutting out the motor S. Then P'' is opened, throwing the entire current through the motor T, giving it a very strong torque.</p></div> </div>
