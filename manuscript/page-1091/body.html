<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It has become a common practice to operate arc lamps by alternating or pulsating, as distinguished from continuous, currents; but an objection which has been raised to such systems exists in the fact that the arcs emit a pronounced sound, varying with the rate of the alternations or pulsations of current. This noise is due to the rapidly alternating heating and cooling, and consequent expansion and contraction, of the gaseous matter forming the arc, which corresponds with the periods or impulses of the current. Another disadvantageous feature is found in the difficulty of maintaining an alternating current arc in consequence of the periodical increase in resistance corresponding to the periodical working of the current. This feature entails a further disadvantage, namely, that small arcs are impracticable.</p></div> </div>
