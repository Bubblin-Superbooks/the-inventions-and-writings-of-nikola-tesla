<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 252.</p><p>In Fig. 248 a somewhat modified form of the invention is shown, a form designed to facilitate the construction and replacing of the parts. In this modification the commutator and collector are made in substantially the same manner as previously described, except that the bands B C are omitted. The four segments of each part, however, are secured to their respective sleeves by screws g' g', and one edge of each segment is cut away, so that small plates a b may be slipped into the spaces thus formed. Of these plates a a are of metal, and are in contact with the metal segments D D', respectively. The other two, b b, are of glass or marble, and they are all better square, as shown in Figs. 249 and 250, so that they may be turned to present new edges should any edge become worn by use.</p></div> </div>
