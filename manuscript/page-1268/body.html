Usually a connecting-rod to a crank upon a fly-wheel shaft would be made use of, as indicated in Fig. 240.</p><p>Fig. 234.Fig. 236.Fig. 235.</p><p>Fig. 232 represents the same parts as before described; but an electro-magnet is illustrated in place of a permanent magnet. The operations, however, are the same.</p><p>In Fig. 233 are shown the same parts as in Figs. 231 and 232, but they are differently arranged. The armature A, instead of swinging, is stationary and held by arm P', and the core N S of the electro-magnet is made to swing within the helix Q, the core being suspended by the arm P from the pivot M.</p></div> </div>
