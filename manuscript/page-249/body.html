<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The cores C, forming the other set are energized by coils E, and the coils are connected, preferably, in series with one another, in two derived or branched circuits, F G, respectively, from a suitable source of current. Each coil E is surrounded by a magnetic shield H, which is preferably composed of an annealed, insulated, or oxidized iron wire wrapped or wound on the coils in the manner indicated so as to form a closed magnetic circuit around the coils and between the same and the magnetic cores C. Between the pole pieces or cores B C is mounted the armature K, which, as is usual in this type of machines, is wound with coils L closed upon themselves. The operation resulting from this disposition is as follows:</p></div> </div>
