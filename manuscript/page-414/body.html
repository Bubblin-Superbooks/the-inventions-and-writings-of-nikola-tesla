<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The molecules or atoms which are near it are, of course, more attracted, and move through a greater distance than the further ones. When the nearest molecules strike the body they are repelled, and collisions occur at all distances within the inductive distance. It is now clear that, if the potential be steady, but little loss of energy can be caused in this way, for the molecules which are nearest to the body having had an additional charge imparted to them by contact, are not attracted until they have parted, if not with all, at least with most of the additional charge, which can be accomplished only after a great many collisions. This is inferred from the fact that with a steady potential there is but little loss in dry air. When the potential, instead of being steady, is alternating, the conditions are entirely different.</p></div> </div>
