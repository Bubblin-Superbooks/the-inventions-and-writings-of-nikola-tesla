<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It is well known that if a magnetic core, even if laminated or subdivided, be wound with an insulated coil and a current of electricity be directed through the coil, the magnetization of the entire core does not immediately ensue, the magnetizing effect not being exhibited in all parts simultaneously. This may be attributed to the fact that the action of the current is to energize first those lamin&aelig; or parts of the core nearest the surface and adjacent to the exciting-coil, and from thence the action progresses toward the interior. A certain interval of time therefore elapses between the manifestation of magnetism in the external and the internal sections or layers of the core. If the core be thin or of small mass, this effect may be inappreciable;</p></div> </div>
