<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> From the nature of this construction it will be obvious that as long as the shield formed by the wires C is below magnetic saturation the secondary coil or circuit is effectually protected or shielded from the inductive influence of the primary, although on open circuit it may exhibit some electromotive force. When the strength of the primary reaches a certain value, the shield C, becoming saturated, ceases to protect the secondary from inductive action, and current is in consequence developed therein. For similar reasons, when the primary current weakens, the weakening of the secondary is retarded to the same or approximately the same extent.</p><p>Fig. 96.</p><p>The specific construction of the transformer is largely immaterial. In Fig. 96, for example, the core A is built up of thin insulated iron plates or discs. The primary circuit D is wound next the core A.</p></div> </div>
