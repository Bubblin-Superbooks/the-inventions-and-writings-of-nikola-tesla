Two thin wires may thus be rendered intensely luminous.</p><p>In order to intensify the streams the wires should be very thin and short; but as in this case their capacity would be generally too small for the coil&mdash;at least for such a one as the present&mdash;it is necessary to augment the capacity to the required value, while, at the same time, the surface of the wires remains very small. This may be done in many ways.</p><p>Here, for instance, I have two plates, R R, of hard rubber (Fig. 138), upon which I have glued two very thin wires w w, so as to form a name. The wires may be bare or covered with the best insulation&mdash;it is immaterial for the success of the experiment. Well insulated wires, if anything, are preferable.</p></div> </div>
