<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the present case the auxiliary brush causes very little or no sparking, and can be taken off without breaking the circuit through the field-helices. The arrangement has, besides, the advantage of facilitating the self-excitation of the machine in all cases where the resistance of the field-wire is very great comparatively to the resistance of the main circuit at the start&mdash;for instance, on arc-light machines. In this case the auxiliary brush c is placed near to, or better still in contact with, the brush b, as shown in Fig. 258. In this manner the part M' is completely cut out, and as the part M has a considerably smaller resistance than the whole length of the field-wire the machine excites itself, whereupon the auxiliary brush is shifted automatically to its normal position.</p></div> </div>
