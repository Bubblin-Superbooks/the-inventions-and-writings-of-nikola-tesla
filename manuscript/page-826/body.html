<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In commercial apparatus, such as incandescent lamps, operated from ordinary systems of distribution, a much higher vacuum than is obtained at present would not secure a very great advantage. In such a case the work is performed on the filament, and the gas is little concerned; the improvement, therefore, would be but trifling. But when we begin to use very high frequencies and potentials, the action of the gas becomes all important, and the degree of exhaustion materially modifies the results. As long as ordinary coils, even very large ones, were used, the study of the subject was limited, because just at a point when it became most interesting it had to be interrupted on account of the "non-striking" vacuum being reached. But at present we are able to obtain from a small disruptive discharge coil potentials much higher than even the largest coil was capable of giving, and, what is more, we can make the potential alternate with great rapidity.</p></div> </div>
