<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It is easy to reach&mdash;even with frequencies obtained from an alternator as here used&mdash;a stage at which the discharge does not pass between two electrodes in a narrow tube, each of these being connected to one of the terminals of the coil, but it is difficult to reach a point at which a luminous discharge would not occur around each electrode.</p><p>A thought which naturally presents itself in connection with high frequency currents, is to make use of their powerful electrodynamic inductive action to produce light effects in a sealed glass globe. The leading-in wire is one of the defects of the present incandescent lamp, and if no other improvement were made, that imperfection at least should be done away with. Following this thought, I have carried on experiments in various directions, of which some were indicated in my former paper. I may here mention one or two more lines of experiment which have been followed up.</p></div> </div>
