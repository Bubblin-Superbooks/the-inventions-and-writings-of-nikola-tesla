Now, when the drop is formed, there will be emitted from it three different kinds of vibrations&mdash;the ordinary visible, and two kinds of invisible waves: that is, the ordinary dark waves of all lengths, and, in addition, waves of a well defined character. The latter would not exist by a steady supply of the energy; still they help to jar and loosen the structure. If this really be the case, then the ruby drop will emit relatively less visible and more invisible waves than before. Thus it would seem that when a platinum wire, for instance, is fused by currents alternating with extreme rapidity, it emits at the point of fusion less light and more visible radiation than it does when melted by a steady current, though the total energy used up in the process of fusion is the same in both cases.</p></div> </div>
