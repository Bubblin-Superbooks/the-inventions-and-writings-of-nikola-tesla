<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I may illustrate the action of the air by the following experiment: I take a short tube which is exhausted to a moderate degree and has a platinum wire running through the middle from one end to the other. I pass a steady or low frequency current through the wire, and it is heated uniformly in all parts. The heating here is due to conduction, or frictional losses, and the gas around the wire has&mdash;as far as we can see&mdash;no function to perform. But now let me pass sudden discharges, or high frequency currents, through the wire. Again the wire is heated, this time principally on the ends and least in the middle portion; and if the frequency of the impulses, or the rate of change, is high enough, the wire might as well be cut in the middle as not, for practically all heating is due to the rarefied gas.</p></div> </div>
