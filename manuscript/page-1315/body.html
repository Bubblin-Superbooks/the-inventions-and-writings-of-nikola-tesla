<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It will have been seen from what was said already that when the electro-motive force between the brushes a and c is to the electromotive force between the brushes c and b as the resistance of the circuit a M c' c A is to the resistance of the circuit b C B c c' D, the potentials of the points x and y will be equal, and no current will pass over the auxiliary brush c; but if that brush occupies a different position relatively to the main brushes the electric condition is disturbed, and current will flow either from y to x or from x to y, according to the relative position of the brushes. In the first case the current through the field-helices will be partly neutralized and the magnetism of the field magnets will be diminished. In the second case the current will be increased and the magnets gain strength.</p></div> </div>
