As the hand is approached, the air between it and the sphere, or in the immediate neighborhood, is more violently agitated, and you see streams of light now break forth from my finger tips and from the whole hand (Fig. 169). Were I to approach the hand closer, powerful sparks would jump from the brass sphere to my hand, which might be injurious.</p></div> </div>
