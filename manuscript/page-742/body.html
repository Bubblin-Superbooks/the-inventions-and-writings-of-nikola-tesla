<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The case is thus analogous to that in which a condenser shunted by a conductor of low resistance is connected to a source of alternating current. As long as the frequencies are low, the conductor gets the most and the condenser is perfectly safe; but when the frequency becomes excessive, the role of the conductor may become quite insignificant. In the latter case the difference of potential at the terminals of the condenser may become so great as to rupture the dielectric, notwithstanding the fact that the terminals are joined by a conductor of low resistance.</p><p>It is, of course, not necessary, when it is desired to produce the incandescence of a body inclosed in a bulb by means of these currents, that the body should be a conductor, for even a perfect non-conductor may be quite as readily heated.</p></div> </div>
