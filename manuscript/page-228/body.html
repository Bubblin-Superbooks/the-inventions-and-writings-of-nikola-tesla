<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The shield H may be made in many forms, as will be understood, and used in different ways, as appears from the foregoing description.</p><p>As a modification of his type of motor with "shielded" fields, Mr. Tesla has constructed a motor with a field-magnet having two sets of poles or inwardly-projecting cores and placed side by side, so as practically to form two fields of force and alternately disposed&mdash;that is to say, with the poles of one set or field opposite the spaces between the other. He then connects the free ends of one set of poles by means of laminated iron bands or bridge-pieces of considerably smaller cross-section than the cores themselves, whereby the cores will all form parts of complete magnetic circuits. When the coils on each set of magnets are connected in multiple circuits or branches from a source of alternating currents, electromotive forces are set up in or impressed upon each circuit simultaneously;</p></div> </div>
