<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> R is a resistance connected in series with the two conductors C C', which by their free terminals are connected up in circuit with one of the conductors L.</p><p>The method of using this device and computing by means thereof the energy of the current will be readily understood. First, the resistances of the two conductors C C', respectively, are accurately measured and noted. Then a known current is passed through the instrument for a given time, and by a second measurement the increase and diminution of the resistances of the two conductors are respectively taken. From these data the constant is obtained&mdash;that is to say, for example, the increase of resistance of one conductor or the diminution of the resistance of the other per lamp hour. These two measurements evidently serve as a check, since the gain of one conductor should equal the loss of the other.</p></div> </div>
