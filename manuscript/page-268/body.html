<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This invention as applied to a derived circuit motor is illustrated in Figs. 70 and 71. The former is an end view of the motor with the armature in section and a diagram of connections, and Fig. 71 a vertical section through the field. These figures are also drawn to show one of the dispositions of two fields that may be adopted in carrying out the principle. The poles B B C C are in one field, the remaining poles in the other. The former are wound with primary coils I J and secondary coils I' J', the latter with coils K L. The primary coils I J are in derived circuits, between which, by reason of their different self-induction, there is a difference of phase, say, of thirty degrees. The coils I' K are in circuit with one another, as also are coils J' L, and there should be a difference of phase between the currents in coils K and L and their corresponding primaries of, say, fifteen degrees.</p></div> </div>
