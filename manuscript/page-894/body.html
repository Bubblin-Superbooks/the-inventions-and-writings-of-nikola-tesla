<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The greatest physicists have not disdained to endeavor to answer this and similar questions and have at times abandoned themselves to the delights of pure and unrestrained thought. Such questions are generally considered not to belong to the realm of positive physical science, but will before long be annexed to its domain. Helmholtz has probably thought more on life than any modern scientist. Lord Kelvin expressed his belief that life's process is electrical and that there is a force inherent to the organism and determining its motions. Just as much as I am convinced of any physical truth I am convinced that the motive impulse must come from the outside. For, consider the lowest organism we know&mdash;and there are probably many lower ones&mdash;an aggregation of a few cells only. If it is capable of voluntary motion it can perform an infinite number of motions, all definite and precise.</p></div> </div>
