<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Now this arc is formed whether there be resonance or not. But even if the spark would not be produced, still there is an alternating e. m. f. set up between the bodies when the plate is brought near one of them; therefore the approach of the plate, if it does not always actually, will, at any rate, tend to break down the air space by inductive action. Instead of the spheres or plates A and B we may take the coatings of a Leyden jar with the same result, and in place of the machine,&mdash;which is a high frequency alternator preferably, because it is more suitable for the experiment and also for the argument,&mdash;we may take another Leyden jar or battery of jars. When such jars are discharging through a circuit of low resistance the same is traversed by currents of very high frequency.</p></div> </div>
