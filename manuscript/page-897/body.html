<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To make this analogy quite complete it is necessary to make the assumption, that the bottom, each time it gives way, is knocked violently against a non-elastic stop, this impact involving some loss of energy; and that, besides, some dissipation of energy results due to frictional losses. In the preceding analogue the liquid is supposed to be under a steady pressure. If the presence of the fluid be assumed to vary rhythmically, this may be taken as corresponding to the case of an alternating current. The process is then not quite as simple to consider, but the action is the same in principle.</p><p>It is desirable, in order to maintain the vibration economically, to reduce the impact and frictional losses as much as possible.</p></div> </div>
