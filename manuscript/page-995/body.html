<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> 179a). In this case all the energy the primary receives is now sunk into it, like the charge of a battery in an ocean cable, but most of that energy is recovered through the secondary and used to light the lamp. The current traversing the primary is strongest at the end b which is connected to the terminal T1 of the induction coil, and diminishes in strength towards the remote end a. But the dynamic inductive effect exerted upon the secondary S is now greater than before, when the suspended plate was connected to the primary. These results might have been produced by a number of causes. For instance, the plate P1 being connected, the reaction from the coil C may be such as to diminish the potential at the terminal T1 of the induction coil, and therefore weaken the current through the primary of the coil C.</p></div> </div>
