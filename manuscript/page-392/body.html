<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It is concluded from this that the total energy lost must be proportionate to the product of the frequency and the square of the electric density; but this law needs experimental confirmation. Assuming the preceding considerations to be true, then, by rapidly alternating the potential of a body immersed in an insulating gaseous medium, any amount of energy may be dissipated into space. Most of that energy, then, is not dissipated in the form of long ether waves, propagated to considerable distance, as is thought most generally, but is consumed in impact and collisional losses&mdash;that is, heat vibrations&mdash;on the surface and in the vicinity of the body. To reduce the dissipation it is necessary to work with a small electric density&mdash;the smaller, the higher the frequency.</p><p>The behavior of a gaseous medium to such rapid alternations of potential makes it appear plausible that electrostatic disturbances of the earth, produced by cosmic events, may have great influence upon the meteorological conditions.</p></div> </div>
