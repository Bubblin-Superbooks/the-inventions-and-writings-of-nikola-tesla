<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The primaries H H' of the induction coils or transformers are connected either in parallel or series with a source of direct or continuous currents I, and the number of convolutions is so calculated for the strength of the current from I that the cores J J' will be saturated. The connections are such that the conditions in the two transformers are of opposite character&mdash;that is to say, the arrangement is such that a current wave or impulse corresponding in direction with that of the direct current in one primary, as H, is of opposite direction to that in the other primary H'. It thus results that while one secondary offers a resistance or opposition to the passage through it of a wave of one sign, the other secondary similarly opposes a wave of opposite sign.</p></div> </div>
