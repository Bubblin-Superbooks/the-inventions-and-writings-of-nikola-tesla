<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> On starting, the switch H is turned to complete the connection between one binding-post P and the field-coils. This short-circuits one of the armature-coils, as G. The other coil F is out of circuit and open. When the motor is up to speed, the switch H is turned back, so that the connection from binding-post P to the field coils is through the coil G, and switch K is closed, thereby including coil F in multiple arc with the field coils. Both armature coils are thus active.</p><p>From the above-described instances it is evident that many other dispositions for carrying out the invention are possible.</p></div> </div>
