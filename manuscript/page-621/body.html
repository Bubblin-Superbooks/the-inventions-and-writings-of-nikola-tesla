However, with incomparably higher frequencies, which we may yet find means to produce efficiently, and provided that electric impulses of such high frequencies could be transmitted through a conductor, the electrical characteristics of the brush discharge would completely vanish&mdash;no spark would pass, no shock would be felt&mdash;yet we would still have to deal with an electric phenomenon, but in the broad, modern interpretation of the word. In my first paper, before referred to, I have pointed out the curious properties of the brush, and described the best manner of producing it, but I have thought it worth while to endeavor to express myself more clearly in regard to this phenomenon, because of its absorbing interest.</p></div> </div>
