<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Many bulbs were constructed as shown in Fig. 161 and Fig. 162.</p><p>Fig. 162.</p><p>In Fig. 161, a wide tube, T, was sealed to a smaller W shaped tube U, of phosphorescent glass. In the tube T, was placed a coil C, of aluminum wire, the ends of which were provided with small spheres, t and t1, of aluminum, and reached into the U tube. The tube T was slipped into a socket containing a primary coil, through which usually the discharges of Leyden jars were directed, and the rarefied gas in the small U tube was excited to strong luminosity by the high-tension current induced in the coil C. When Leyden jar discharges were used to induce currents in the coil C, it was found necessary to pack the tube T tightly with insulating powder, as a discharge would occur frequently between the turns of the coil, especially when the primary was thick and the air gap, through which the jars discharged, large, and no little trouble was experienced in this way.</p></div> </div>
