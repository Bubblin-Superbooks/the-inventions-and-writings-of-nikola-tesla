<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>G is a water-supply pipe, and H is the steam-exhaust pipe, which communicates with all the tubes C in the armature B, so that steam escaping from the boiler will pass through the tubes.</p><p>In the steam-exhaust pipe H is a valve V, to which is connected the lever I, by the movement of which the valve is opened or closed. In such a case as this the heat of the fire may be utilized for other purposes after as much of it as may be needed has been applied to heating the core B. There are special advantages in the employment of a cooling device, in that the metal of the core B is not so quickly oxidized. Moreover, the difference between the temperature of the applied heat and of the steam, air, or whatever gas or fluid be applied as the cooling medium, may be increased or decreased at will, whereby the rapidity of the magnetic changes or fluctuations may be regulated.</p></div> </div>
