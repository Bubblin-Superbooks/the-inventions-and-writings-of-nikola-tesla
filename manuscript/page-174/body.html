<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For instance, instead of using the switch shown in the previous figures, we may use a temporary ground circuit between the generator and motor, in order to start the motor, in substantially the manner indicated in Fig. 40. Let G in this figure represent an ordinary alternating-current generator with, say, two poles, M M', and an armature wound with two coils, N N', at right angles and connected in series. The motor has, for example, four poles wound with coils B C, which are connected in series, and an armature with polar projections D wound with closed coils E E. From the common joint or union between the two circuits of both the generator and the motor an earth connection is established, while the terminals or ends of these circuits are connected to the line.</p></div> </div>
