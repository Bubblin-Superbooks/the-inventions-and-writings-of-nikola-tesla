Leaving practicability out of consideration, this, then, would be the means which, in my opinion, would enable us to reach the highest temperature. But a great difficulty when proceeding in this way is encountered, namely, in most cases the body is carried off before it can fuse and form a drop. This difficulty exists principally with an oxide, such as zirconia, because it cannot be compressed in so hard a cake that it would not be carried off quickly. I have endeavored repeatedly to fuse zirconia, placing it in a cup of arc light carbon, as indicated in Fig. 152. It glowed with a most intense light, and the stream of the particles projected out of the carbon cup was of a vivid white;</p></div> </div>
