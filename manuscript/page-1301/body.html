The adjustment is such that when the solenoid is traversed by the normal current it is just strong enough to balance the downward pull of the parts.</p><p>Fig. 267.</p><p>The electrical circuit-connections are substantially the same as indicated in the previous diagrams, the solenoid being in series with the circuit when the translating devices are in series, and in shunt when the devices are in multiple arc. The operation of the device is as follows: When upon a decrease of the resistance of the circuit or for some other reason, the current is increased, the solenoid S gains in strength and pulls up the iron core I, thus shifting the main brushes in the direction of rotation and the auxiliary brushes in the opposite way.</p></div> </div>
