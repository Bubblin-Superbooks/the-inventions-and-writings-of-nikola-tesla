Figs. 254 and 255 are diagrams showing one core of the field-magnets with a portion of the helices wound in opposite directions. Figs. 256 and 257 are diagrams illustrating the electric devices that may be employed for automatically adjusting the brushes, and Fig. 258 is a diagram illustrating the positions of the brushes when the machine is being energized at the start.</p></div> </div>
