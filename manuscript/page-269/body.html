<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If the poles B C are at right angles, the armature-coils should be connected directly across, or a single armature core wound from end to end may be used; but if the poles B C be in line there should be an angular displacement of the armature coils, as will be well understood.</p><p>The operation will be understood from the foregoing. The maximum magnetic condition of a pair of poles, as B' B', coincides closely with the maximum effect in the armature, which lags behind the corresponding condition in poles B B.</p></div> </div>
