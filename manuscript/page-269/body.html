<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As has been pointed out elsewhere, the lag or retardation of the phases of an alternating current is directly proportional to the self-induction and inversely proportional to the resistance of the circuit through which the current flows. Hence, in order to secure the proper differences of phase between the two motor-circuits, it is desirable to make the self-induction in one much higher and the resistance much lower than the self-induction and resistance, respectively, in the other. At the same time the magnetic quantities of the two poles or sets of poles which the two circuits produce should be approximately equal. These requirements have led Mr. Tesla to the invention of a motor having the following general characteristics: The coils which are included in that energizing circuit which is to have the higher self-induction are made of coarse wire, or a conductor of relatively low resistance, and with the greatest possible length or number of turns.</p></div> </div>
