<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The electrical circuit-connections are substantially the same as indicated in the previous diagrams, the solenoid being in series with the circuit when the translating devices are in series, and in shunt when the devices are in multiple arc. The operation of the device is as follows: When upon a decrease of the resistance of the circuit or for some other reason, the current is increased, the solenoid S gains in strength and pulls up the iron core I, thus shifting the main brushes in the direction of rotation and the auxiliary brushes in the opposite way. This diminishes the strength of the current until the opposing forces are balanced and the solenoid is traversed by the normal current; but if from any cause the current in the circuit is diminished, then the weight of the moving parts overcomes the pull of the solenoid, the iron core I descends, thus shifting the brushes the opposite way and increasing the current to the normal strength.</p></div> </div>
