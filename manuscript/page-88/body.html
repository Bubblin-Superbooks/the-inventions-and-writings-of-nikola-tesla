Referring to Fig. 11, we have r2 = x2 + y2; where x = r cos α, and y = r sin α.</p><p>Assuming the magnetizing effect of each set of coils in the transformer to be proportional to the current&mdash;which may be admitted for weak degrees of magnetization&mdash;then x = Kc and y = Kc1, where K is a constant and c and c1 the current in both sets of coils respectively. Supposing, further, the field of the generator to be uniform, we have for constant speed c1 = K1 sin α and c = K1 sin (90&deg; + α) = K1 cos α, where K1 is a constant. See Fig. 12.</p></div> </div>
