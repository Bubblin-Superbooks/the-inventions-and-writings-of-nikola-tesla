<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I cannot find words to express how deeply I feel the honor of addressing some of the foremost thinkers of the present time, and so many able scientific men, engineers and electricians, of the country greatest in scientific achievements.</p><p>The results which I have the honor to present before such a gathering I cannot call my own. There are among you not a few who can lay better claim than myself on any feature of merit which this work may contain. I need not mention many names which are world-known&mdash;names of those among you who are recognized as the leaders in this enchanting science; but one, at least, I must mention&mdash;a name which could not be omitted in a demonstration of this kind. It is a name associated with the most beautiful invention ever made: it is Crookes!</p></div> </div>
