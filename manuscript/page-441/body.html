<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mr. Tesla, true philosopher as he is, does not hesitate to point out defects in some of his methods, and indicates the lines which to him seem the most promising. Particular stress is laid by him upon the employment of a medium in which the discharge electrodes should be immersed in order that this method of conversion may be brought to the highest perfection. He has evidently taken pains to give as much useful information as possible to those who wish to follow in his path, as he shows in detail the circuit arrangements to be adopted in all ordinary cases met with in practice, and although some of these methods were described by him two years before, the additional information is still timely and welcome.</p><p>In his experiments he dwells first on some phenomena produced by electrostatic force, which he considers in the light of modern theories to be the most important force in nature for us to investigate.</p></div> </div>
