<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The switch used is of substantially the same construction as that shown in the previous figure. There are, however, five contacts, designated as 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The motor-circuits B C, which include alternate field-coils, are connected to the terminals in the following order: One end of circuit C is connected to contact 9 and to contact 5 through a dead resistance, I. One terminal of circuit B is connected to contact 7 and to contact 6 through a self-induction coil, J. The opposite terminals of both circuits are connected to contact 8.</p><p>One of the levers, as F, of the switch is made with an extension, f, or otherwise, so as to cover both contacts 5 and 6 when shifted into the position to start the motor.</p></div> </div>
