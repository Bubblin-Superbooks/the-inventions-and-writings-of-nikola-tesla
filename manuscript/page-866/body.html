The stem s is provided with an aluminum tube a, for purposes before explained, and only a small part of the filament reaches out of this tube. By holding the tube T1 anywhere in the electrostatic field, the filament is rendered incandescent.</p><p>A more interesting piece of apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 164. The construction is the same as before, only instead of the lamp filament a small platinum wire p, sealed in a stem s, and bent above it in a circle, is connected to the copper wire w, which is joined to an inside coating C.</p></div> </div>
