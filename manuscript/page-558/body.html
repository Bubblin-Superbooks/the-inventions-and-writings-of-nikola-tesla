The regulation would offer no difficulties, as with currents of such frequencies it is very easy to maintain a constant current.</p><p>In the accompanying engravings some of the types of lamps of this kind are shown. Fig. 120 is such a lamp with a broken filament, and Figs. 121 A and 121 B one with a single outside and inside coating and a single filament. I have also made lamps with two outside and inside coatings and a continuous loop connecting the latter. Such lamps have been operated by me with current impulses of the enormous frequencies obtainable by the disruptive discharge of condensers.</p><p>The disruptive discharge of a condenser is especially suited for operating such lamps&mdash;with no outward electrical connections&mdash;by means of electromagnetic induction, the electromagnetic inductive effects being excessively high;</p></div> </div>
