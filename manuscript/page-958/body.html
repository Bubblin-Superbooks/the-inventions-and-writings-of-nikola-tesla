<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> One might take a core of some size, laminated or not, it would matter little; but ordinary iron wire 1/16th or 1/8th of an inch thick is suitable for the purpose. While the induction coil is working, a current traverses the inserted coil and only a few moments are sufficient to bring the iron wire i to an elevated temperature sufficient to soften the sealing-wax s, and cause a paper washer p fastened by it to the iron wire to fall off. But with the apparatus such as I have here, other, much more interesting, demonstrations of this kind can be made. I have a secondary S, Fig 176, of coarse wire, wound upon a coil similar to the first. In the preceding experiment the current through the coil C, Fig. 175, was very small, but there being many turns a strong heating effect was, nevertheless, produced in the iron wire.</p></div> </div>
