Produced with, say, twenty thousand alternations per second, the heat is easily perceptible even if the potential is not excessively high. The heat developed is, of course, due to the impact of the air molecules against the terminals and against each other. As, at the ordinary pressures, the mean free path is excessively small, it is possible that in spite of the enormous initial speed imparted to each molecule upon coming in contact with the terminal, its progress&mdash;by collision with other molecules&mdash;is retarded to such an extent, that it does not get away far from the terminal, but may strike the same many times in succession.</p></div> </div>
