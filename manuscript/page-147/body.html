Fig. 35 is a broken section on line x x of Fig. 34. Fig. 36 is a diagram illustrating the most convenient manner of applying the regulator to ordinary forms of motors, and Fig. 37 is a similar diagram illustrating the application of the device to the Tesla alternating-current motors.</p></div> </div>
