<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The construction of the armature may be the same as in the previous figure, or it may be simply a magnetic disc or cylinder, as shown, and a coil or coils F F are secured in position to surround both the armature and the poles C C'. The armature is detachable from its shaft, the latter being passed through the armature after it has been inserted in position. The operation of this form of motor is the same in principle as that previously described and needs no further explanation.</p><p>Fig. 56.</p><p>Fig. 57.</p><p>One of the most important features in alternating current motors is, however, that they should be adapted to and capable of running efficiently on the alternating circuits in present use, in which almost without exception the generators yield a very high number of alternations.</p></div> </div>
