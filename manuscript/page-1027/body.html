<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This result I secure by charging, from an ordinary transformer which is fed from the alternating current supply station, a battery of condensers, and discharging the latter directly through a circuit of small self-induction, as before illustrated in Figs. 183a, 183b, and 183c.</p><p>.Fig. 186b.Fig. 186c.</p><p>In Figs. 186a, 186b and 186c, the heavy copper bars B B1, are connected to the opposite coatings of a battery of condensers, or generally in such way, that the high frequency or sudden discharges are made to traverse them. I connect first an ordinary 50-volt incandescent lamp to the bars by means of the clamps c c. The discharges being passed through the lamp, the filament is rendered incandescent, though the current through it is very small, and would not be nearly sufficient to produce a visible effect under the conditions of ordinary use of the lamp.</p></div> </div>
