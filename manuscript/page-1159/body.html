<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In all forms of apparatus used there was no special difficulty in exciting a luminous circle or cylinder in proximity to the primary.</p><p>As to the number of turns, I cannot quite understand why Prof. J. J. Thomson should think that a few turns were "quite sufficient," but lest I should impute to him an opinion he may not have, I will add that I have gained this impression from the reading of the published abstracts of his lecture. Clearly, the number of turns which gives the best result in any case, is dependent on the dimensions of the apparatus, and, were it not for various considerations, one turn would always give the best result.</p><p>I have found that it is preferable to use in these experiments an alternate current machine giving a moderate number of alternations per second to excite the induction coil for charging the Leyden jar which discharges through the primary&mdash;shown diagrammatically in Fig.</p></div> </div>
