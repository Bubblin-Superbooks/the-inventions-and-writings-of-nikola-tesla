The motor here shown in Fig. 41 is one of the ordinary forms, with field-cores either laminated or solid and with a cylindrical laminated armature wound, for example, with the coils A B at right angles. The shaft of the armature carries three collecting or contact rings C D E. (Shown, for better illustration, as of different diameters.)</p><p>One end of coil A connects to one ring, as C, and one end of coil B connects with ring D. The remaining ends are connected to ring E. Collecting springs or brushes F G H bear upon the rings and lead to the contacts of a switch, to be presently described. The field-coils have their terminals in binding-posts K K, and may be either closed upon themselves or connected with a source of direct current L, by means of a switch M.</p></div> </div>
