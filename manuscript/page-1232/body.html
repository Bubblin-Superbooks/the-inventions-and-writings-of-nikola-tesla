<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A further check is afforded by measuring both wires in series with the resistance, in which case the resistance of the whole should remain constant.</p><p>In Fig. 230 the conductors C C' are connected in parallel, the current device at X passing in one branch first through a resistance R' and then through conductor C, while on the other branch it passes first through conductor C', and then through resistance R''. The resistances R' R'' are equal, as also are the resistances of the conductors C C'. It is, moreover, preferable that the respective resistances of the conductors C C' should be a known and convenient fraction of the coils or resistances R' R''. It will be observed that in the arrangement shown in Fig. 230 there is a constant potential difference between the two conductors C C' throughout their entire length.</p></div> </div>
