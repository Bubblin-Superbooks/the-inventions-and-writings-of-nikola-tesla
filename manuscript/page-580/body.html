<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We arrange the circuits properly, and we see the mass of iron and wires behave as though it were endowed with life, spinning a heavy armature, through invisible connections, with great speed and power&mdash;with the energy possibly conveyed from a great distance. We observe how the energy of an alternating current traversing the wire manifests itself&mdash;not so much in the wire as in the surrounding space&mdash;in the most surprising manner, taking the forms of heat, light, mechanical energy, and, most surprising of all, even chemical affinity. All these observations fascinate us, and fill us with an intense desire to know more about the nature of these phenomena. Each day we go to our work in the hope of discovering,&mdash;in the hope that some one, no matter who, may find a solution of one of the pending great problems,&mdash;and each succeeding day we return to our task with renewed ardor;</p></div> </div>
