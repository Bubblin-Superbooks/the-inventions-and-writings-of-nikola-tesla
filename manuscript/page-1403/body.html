The direction of the resulting currents in the latter may be assumed to be as indicated by the dotted lines and arrows m and n; and the direction of the energizing field current being indicated by the arrows a b c d, an inspection of the figure shows that one of the two branches of the eddy current, that is, A B' m B, will tend to demagnetize the field, while the other branch, that is, A B' n B, will have the opposite effect.</p></div> </div>
