<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One of the changes is that the adjustable knobs A and B (Fig. 133), of the discharger are held in jaws of brass, J J, by spring pressure, this allowing of turning them successively into different positions, and so doing away with the tedious process of frequent polishing up.</p><p>Fig. 133.</p><p>The other change consists in the employment of a strong electromagnet N S, which is placed with its axis at right angles to the line joining the knobs A and B, and produces a strong magnetic field between them. The pole pieces of the magnet are movable and properly formed so as to protrude between the brass knobs, in order to make the field as intense as possible; but to prevent the discharge from jumping to the magnet the pole pieces are protected by a layer of mica, M M, of sufficient thickness; s1 s1 and s2 s2 are screws for fastening the wires.</p></div> </div>
