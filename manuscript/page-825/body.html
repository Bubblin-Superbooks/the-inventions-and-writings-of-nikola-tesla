<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> With potentials which we are able to obtain, even with a disruptive discharge coil, the speed must be quite insignificant.</p><p>As to the "non-striking vacuum," the point to be noted is, that it can occur only with low frequency impulses, and it is necessitated by the impossibility of carrying off enough energy with such impulses in high vacuum, since the few atoms which are around the terminal upon coming in contact with the same, are repelled and kept at a distance for a comparatively long period of time, and not enough work can be performed to render the effect perceptible to the eye. If the difference of potential between the terminals is raised, the dielectric breaks down. But with very high frequency impulses there is no necessity for such breaking down, since any amount of work can be performed by continually agitating the atoms in the exhausted vessel, provided the frequency is high enough.</p></div> </div>
