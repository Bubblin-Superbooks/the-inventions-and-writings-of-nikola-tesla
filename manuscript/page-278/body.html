<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 74.</p><p>This action or principle of operation has been embodied in a practicable form of motor, which is illustrated in Fig. 73. Let A in that figure represent a circular frame of iron, from diametrically opposite points of the interior of which the cores project. Each core is composed of three main parts B, B and C, and they are similarly formed with a straight portion or body e, around which the energizing coil is wound, a curved arm or extension c, and an inwardly projecting pole or end d. Each core is made up of two parts B B, with their polar extensions reaching in one direction, and a part C between the other two, and with its polar extension reaching in the opposite direction. In order to lessen in the cores the circulation of currents induced therein, the several sections are insulated from one another in the manner usually followed in such cases.</p></div> </div>
