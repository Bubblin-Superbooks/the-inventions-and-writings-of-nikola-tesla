<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The contact 1 is connected to contact 2 through an artificial resistance, I, and contact 3 with contact 4 through a self-induction coil, J, so that when the switch levers are shifted upon the points 1 and 3 the circuits of coils B and C will be connected in multiple arc or derivation to the circuit L L', and will include the resistance and self-induction coil respectively. A third position of the switch is that in which the levers F and F' are shifted out of contact with both sets of points. In this case the motor is entirely out of circuit.</p><p>The purpose and manner of operating the motor by these devices are as follows: The normal position of the switch, the motor being out of circuit, is off the contact points.</p></div> </div>
