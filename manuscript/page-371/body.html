The secondary B is wound over the shield C. In Fig. 96, also, E is a source of alternating or rapidly changing currents. The primary of the transformer is connected with the circuit of the generator. F is a two-circuit alternating current motor, one of the circuits being connected with the main circuit from the source E, and the other being supplied with currents from the secondary of the transformer.</p></div> </div>
