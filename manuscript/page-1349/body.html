In this case the passive or electrically-inactive wires are of the smallest length practicable. The arrangement has further the advantage that the total lengths of the crossing wires at the two sides of the plane x x are practically equal.</p><p>Fig. 274.</p><p>To equalize further the armature coils at both sides of the plates that are in contact with the brushes, the winding and connecting up is effected in the following manner: The whole wire is wound upon the armature-core in two superimposed parts, which are thoroughly insulated from each other. Each of these two parts is composed of three separated groups of coils.</p></div> </div>
