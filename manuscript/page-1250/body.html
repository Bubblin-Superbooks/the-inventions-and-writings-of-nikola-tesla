<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 227.</p><p>Fig. 228.</p><p>In the accompanying illustrations, Fig. 227 is a section of a condenser constructed in accordance with this principle and having stationary plates; and Fig. 228 is a similar view of a condenser with adjustable plates.</p><p>Any suitable box or receptacle A may be used to contain the plates or armatures. These latter are designated by B and C and are connected, respectively, to terminals D and E, which pass out through the sides of the case. The plates ordinarily are separated by strips of porous insulating material F, which are used merely for the purpose of maintaining them in position. The space within the can is filled with oil G. Such a condenser will prove highly efficient and will not become heated or permanently injured.</p></div> </div>
