<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It will be obvious that if the direction of magnetism in both fields be the same, the same result as above will be obtained by driving the discs in opposite directions and crossing the connecting belts. In this way the difficulty of securing and maintaining good contact with the peripheries of the discs is avoided and a cheap and durable machine made which is useful for many purposes&mdash;such as for an exciter for alternating current generators, for a motor, and for any other purpose for which dynamo machines are used.</p><p>Fig. 290.Fig. 291.</p><p>Fig. 290 is a side view, partly in section, of this machine. Fig. 291 is a vertical section of the same at right angles to the shafts.</p></div> </div>
