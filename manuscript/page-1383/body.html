This clamping and releasing of the rod continues until the carbons are consumed. In practice the feed is so sensitive that for the greatest part of the time the movement of the rod cannot be detected without some actual measurement. During the normal operation of the lamp the armature lever L remains practically stationary, in the position shown in Fig. 283.</p><p>Should it happen that, owing to an imperfection in it, the rod and the carbons drop too far, so as to make the arc too short, or even bring the carbons in contact, a very small amount of current passes through the fine wire, and the compound magnet becomes sufficiently strong to act as at the start in pulling the armature lever L down and separating the carbons to a greater distance.</p></div> </div>
