<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As the condenser capacity which is needed in any particular motor of this kind is dependent upon the rate of alternation or the potential, or both, its size or cost, as before explained, may be brought within economical limits for use with the ordinary circuits if the potential of the secondary circuit in the motor be sufficiently high. By giving to the condenser proper values, any desired difference of phase between the primary and secondary energizing circuits may be obtained.</p></div> </div>
