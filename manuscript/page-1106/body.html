<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The core for the field magnet is built up of two circular parts H H, formed with annular grooves I, which, when the two parts are brought together, form a space for the reception of the energizing coil G. The hubs of the cores are trued off, so as to fit closely against one another, while the outer portions or flanges which form the polar faces J J, are reduced somewhat in thickness to make room for the conductor D, and are serrated on their faces. The number of serrations in the polar faces is arbitrary; but there must exist between them and the radial portions of the conductor D certain relation, which will be understood by reference to Fig. 207 in which N N represent the projections or points on one face of the core of the field, and S S the points of the other face.</p></div> </div>
