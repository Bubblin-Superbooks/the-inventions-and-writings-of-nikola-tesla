<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When the alternations are very low there is no doubt that a considerable portion of the energy is given off by the electrification of the surrounding air.</p><p>In order to study this subject better, I carried on some experiments with excessively high potentials and low frequencies. I then observed that when the hand is approached to the bulb,&mdash;the filament being connected with one terminal of the coil,&mdash;a powerful vibration is felt, being due to the attraction and repulsion of the molecules of the air which are electrified by induction through the glass. In some cases when the action is very intense I have been able to hear a sound, which must be due to the same cause.</p></div> </div>
