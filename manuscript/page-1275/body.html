<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The spring W acts against a lever arm that projects from the armature, and the supply of heat has to be partly cut off by a connection to the swinging armature, so as to lessen the heat acting upon the keeper plate when the armature A has been attracted.</p><p>Fig. 240.Fig. 241.</p><p>Fig. 239 is similar to Fig. 238, except that the keeper T is not made use of and the armature itself swings into and out of the range of the intense action of the heat from the burner H. Fig. 240 is a diagram similar to Fig. 231, except that in place of using a spring and stops, the armature is shown as connected by a link, to the crank of a fly-wheel, so that the fly-wheel will be revolved as rapidly as the armature can be heated and cooled to the necessary extent. A spring may be used in addition, as in Fig. 231. In Fig.</p></div> </div>
