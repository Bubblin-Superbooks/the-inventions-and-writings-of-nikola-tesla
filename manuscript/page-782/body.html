The high frequency secures, among others, two chief advantages, which have a most important bearing upon the economy of the light production. First, the deterioration of the electrode is reduced by reason of the fact that we employ a great many small impacts, instead of a few violent ones, which quickly shatter the structure; secondly, the formation of a large photosphere is facilitated.</p></div> </div>
