<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> These effects Mr. Tesla has utilized and applied in a variety of ways in the construction and operation of his motors, such as by producing a difference in phase in the two energizing circuits of an alternating current motor by connecting the two circuits in derivation and connecting up a condenser in series in one of the circuits. A further development, however, possesses certain novel features of practical value and involves a knowledge of facts less generally understood. It comprises the use of a condenser or condensers in connection with the induced or armature circuit of a motor and certain details of the construction of such motors. In an alternating current motor of the type particularly referred to above, or in any other which has an armature coil or circuit closed upon itself, the latter represents not only an inductive resistance, but one which is periodically varying in value, both of which facts complicate and render difficult the attainment of the conditions best suited to the most efficient working conditions;</p></div> </div>
