This is readily attained by making the proper electrical connections. The effect of such a change, however, would be the same as reducing the number of poles one-half, and thereby doubling the speed of any given motor.</p><p>Fig. 32.</p><p>It is obvious that the Tesla electrical transformers which have independent primary currents may be used with the generators described. It may also be stated with respect to the devices we now describe that the most perfect and harmonious action of the generators and motors is obtained when the numbers of the poles of each are even and not odd. If this is not the case, there will be a certain unevenness of action which is the less appreciable as the number of poles is greater;</p></div> </div>
