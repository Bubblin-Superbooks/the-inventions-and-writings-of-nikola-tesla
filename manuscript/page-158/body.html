<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In Fig. 37, let P represent a Tesla generator having two independent coils, P' and P'', on the armature, and T a diagram of a motor having two independent energizing coils or sets of coils, R R'. One of the circuits from the generator, as S' S', includes one set, R' R', of the energizing coils of the motor, while the other circuit, as S S, includes the primary coils of the regulator. The secondary coil of the regulator includes the other coils, R R, of the motor.</p><p>While the secondary coil of the regulator is in its normal position, it produces its maximum current, and the maximum rotary effect is imparted to the motor; but this effect will be diminished in proportion to the angle at which the coil F of the regulator is turned.</p></div> </div>
