<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Such a motor, of the type under consideration, Mr. Tesla has designed by a development of the principle of the motor shown in Fig. 56, making a multipolar motor, which is illustrated in Fig. 57. In the construction of this motor he employs an annular magnetic frame J, with inwardly-extending ribs or projections K, the ends of which all bend or turn in one direction and are generally shaped to conform to the curved surface of the armature. Coils F F are wound from one part K to the one next adjacent, the ends or loops of each coil or group of wires being carried over toward the shaft, so as to form U-shaped groups of convolutions at each end of the armature. The pole-pieces C C', being substantially concentric with the armature, form ledges, along which the coils are laid and should project to some extent beyond the the coils, as shown.</p></div> </div>
