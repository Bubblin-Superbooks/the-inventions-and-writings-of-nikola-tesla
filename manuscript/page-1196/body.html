The current in either branch may be used in the same way and for the same purposes as any other direct current&mdash;that is, it may be made to charge secondary batteries, energize electro-magnets, or for any other analogous purpose.</p><p>Fig. 220 represents a plan of directing the alternating currents by means of devices purely electrical in character. Figs. 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, and 226 are diagrams illustrative of other ways of carrying out the invention.</p><p>In Fig. 220, A designates a generator of alternating currents, and B B the main or line circuit therefrom. At any given point in this circuit at or near which it is desired to obtain direct currents, the circuit B is divided into two paths or branches C D.</p></div> </div>
