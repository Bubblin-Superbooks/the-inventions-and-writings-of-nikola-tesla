But the circles were always in close proximity to the primary and were considerably easier produced when the latter was very close to the glass, much more so than would be expected assuming the action to be electromagnetic and considering the distance; and these facts speak for an electrostatic effect.</p><p>Fig. 214.</p><p>Fig. 215.</p><p>Furthermore I have observed that there is a molecular bombardment in the plane of the luminous circle at right angles to the glass&mdash;supposing the circle to be in the plane of the primary&mdash;this bombardment being evident from the rapid heating of the glass near the primary. Were the bombardment not at right angles to the glass the heating could not be so rapid.</p></div> </div>
