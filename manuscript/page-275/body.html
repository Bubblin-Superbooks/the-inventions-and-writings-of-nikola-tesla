<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Let it be assumed that the energy as represented in the magnetism in the field of a given rotating field motor is ninety and that of the armature ten. The sum of these quantities, which represents the total energy expended in driving the motor, is one hundred; but, assuming that the motor be so constructed that the energy in the field is represented by fifty, and that in the armature by fifty, the sum is still one hundred; but while in the first instance the product is nine hundred, in the second it is two thousand five hundred, and as the energy developed is in proportion to these products it is clear that those motors are the most efficient&mdash;other things being equal&mdash;in which the magnetic energies developed in the armature and field are equal.</p></div> </div>
