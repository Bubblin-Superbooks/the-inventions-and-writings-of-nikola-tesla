<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If, now, the arc becomes too long, the current through the helix M is lessened, and the magnetism of the core N3 is increased by the greater current passing through the shunt, and this core N3, attracting the segmental armature r, lessens the hold of the clamp R upon the rod S, allowing the latter to slide and lessen the length of the arc, which instantly restores the magnetic equilibrium and causes the clamp R to hold the rod S. If it happens that the carbons fall into contact, then the magnetism of N2 is lessened so much that the attraction of the magnet M will be sufficient to move the armature a and lever A so that the armature b passes above the normal position, so as to separate the carbons instantly;</p></div> </div>
