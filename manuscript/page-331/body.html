With this induction device is used an alternating current generator with coils or sets of coils to correspond with those of the converter, and the corresponding coils of the generator and converter are then connected up in independent circuits. It results from this that the different electrical phases in the generator are attended by corresponding magnetic changes in the converter; or, in other words, that as the generator coils revolve, the points of greatest magnetic intensity in the converter will be progressively shifted or whirled around.</p><p>Fig. 92 is a diagrammatic illustration of the converter and the electrical connections of the same. Fig. 93 is a horizontal central cross-section of Fig. 92. Fig. 94 is a diagram of the circuits of the entire system, the generator being shown in section.</p></div> </div>
