Instead of using four wires, with like result, three wires may be used, one forming a common return for both circuits.</p><p>Fig. 7.</p><p>Fig. 7a.</p><p>This rotation or whirling of the poles manifests itself in a series of curious phenomena. If a delicately pivoted disc of steel or other magnetic metal is approached to the ring it is set in rapid rotation, the direction of rotation varying with the position of the disc. For instance, noting the direction outside of the ring it will be found that inside the ring it turns in an opposite direction, while it is unaffected if placed in a position symmetrical to the ring. This is easily explained.</p></div> </div>
