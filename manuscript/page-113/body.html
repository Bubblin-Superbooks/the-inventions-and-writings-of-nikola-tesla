In this special plan of connections, the rotation of the magnetic poles of the converter will be synchronous with that of the armature coils of the generator, and the result will be the same, whether the energizing circuits are derivations from a continuous armature coil or from independent coils, as in Mr. Tesla's other devices.</p><p>In Fig. 25, the brushes M M are shown in dotted lines in their proper normal position.</p></div> </div>
