The next thought is to employ electrostatic screens. The insulation of the wire may be covered with a thin conducting coating and the latter connected to the ground. But this would not do, as then all the energy would pass through the conducting coating to the ground and nothing would get to the end of the wire. If a ground connection is made it can only be made through a conductor offering an enormous impedance, or through a condenser of extremely small capacity. This, however, does not do away with other difficulties.</p><p>If the wave length of the impulses is much smaller than the length of the wire, then corresponding short waves will be set up in the conducting coating, and it will be more or less the same as though the coating were directly connected to earth.</p></div> </div>
