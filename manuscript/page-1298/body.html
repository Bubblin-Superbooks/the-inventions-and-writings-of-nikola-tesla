<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In this way both brush-holders can turn very freely, the friction of the parts being reduced to a minimum. Over the brush-holders is mounted the solenoid S, which rests upon a forked column, c. This column also affords a support for the pivots p p, and is fastened upon a solid bracket or projection, P, which extends from the base of the machine, and is cast in one piece with the same. The brush-holders B B' are connected by means of the links e e and the cross-piece F to the iron core I, which slides freely in the tube T of the solenoid. The iron core I has a screw, s, by means of which it can be raised and adjusted in its position relatively to the solenoid, so that the pull exerted upon it by the solenoid is practically uniform through the whole length of motion which is required to effect the regulation.</p></div> </div>
