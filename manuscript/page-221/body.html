<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In that class of motors in which two or more sets of energizing magnets are employed, and in which by artificial means a certain interval of time is made to elapse between the respective maximum or minimum periods or phases of their magnetic attraction or effect, the interval or difference in phase between the two sets of magnets is limited in extent. It is desirable, however, for the economical working of such motors that the strength or attraction of one set of magnets should be maximum, at the time when that of the other set is minimum, and conversely; but these conditions have not heretofore been realized except in cases where the two currents have been obtained from independent sources in the same or different machines.</p></div> </div>
