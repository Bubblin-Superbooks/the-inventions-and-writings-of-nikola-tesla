<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Were we to take a large hollow metallic sphere and fill it with a perfect, incompressible, fluid dielectric, there would be no loss inside of the sphere, and consequently the inside might be considered as perfectly screened, though the potential be very rapidly alternating. Even were the sphere filled with oil, the loss would be incomparably smaller than when the fluid is replaced by a gas, for in the latter case the force produces displacements; that means impact and collisions in the inside.</p><p>No matter what the pressure of the gas may be, it becomes an important factor in the heating of a conductor when the electric density is great and the frequency very high. That in the heating of conductors by lightning discharges, air is an element of great importance, is almost as certain as an experimental fact.</p></div> </div>
