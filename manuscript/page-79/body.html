<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 14.</p><p>The object has been attained by placing within the ring a properly subdivided cylindrical iron core wound with several independent coils closed upon themselves. Two coils at right angles as in Fig. 14, are sufficient, but a greater number may be advantageously employed. It results from this disposition that when the poles of the ring are shifted, currents are generated in the closed armature coils. These currents are the most intense at or near the points of the greatest density of the lines of force, and their effect is to produce poles upon the armature at right angles to those of the ring, at least theoretically so; and since this action is entirely independent of the speed&mdash;that is, as far as the location of the poles is concerned&mdash;a continuous pull is exerted upon the periphery of the armature. In many respects these motors are similar to the continuous current motors.</p></div> </div>
