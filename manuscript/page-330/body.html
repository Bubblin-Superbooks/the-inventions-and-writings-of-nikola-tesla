In these transformers he provides a series of inducing coils and corresponding induced coils, which are generally wound upon a core closed upon itself, usually a ring of laminated iron.</p><p>The two sets of coils are wound side by side or superposed or otherwise placed in well-known ways to bring them into the most effective relations to one another and to the core. The inducing or primary coils wound on the core are divided into pairs or sets by the proper electrical connections, so that while the coils of one pair or set co-operate in fixing the magnetic poles of the core at two given diametrically opposite points, the coils of the other pair or set&mdash;</p></div> </div>
