<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For example, a given motor having, say, eight poles should run, with the armature coil short-circuited, at two thousand revolutions per minute to bring it up to synchronism. It will generally happen, however, that this speed is not reached, owing to the fact that the armature and field currents do not properly correspond, so that when the current is passed through the armature (the motor not being quite up to synchronism) there is a liability that it will not "hold on," as it is termed. It is preferable, therefore, to so wind or construct the motor that on the start, when the armature coils are short-circuited, the motor will tend to reach a speed higher than the synchronous&mdash;as for instance, double the latter. In such case the difficulty above alluded to is not felt, for the motor will always hold up to synchronism if the synchronous speed&mdash;in the case supposed of two thousand revolutions&mdash;</p></div> </div>
