<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The production of a small electrode, capable of withstanding enormous temperatures, I regard as of the greatest importance in the manufacture of light. It would enable us to obtain, by means of currents of very high frequencies, certainly 20 times, if not more, the quantity of light which is obtained in the present incandescent lamp by the same expenditure of energy. This estimate may appear to many exaggerated, but in reality I think it is far from being so. As this statement might be misunderstood, I think it is necessary to expose clearly the problem with which, in this line of work, we are confronted, and the manner in which, in my opinion, a solution will be arrived at.</p><p>Any one who begins a study of the problem will be apt to think that what is wanted in a lamp with an electrode is a very high degree of incandescence of the electrode. There he will be mistaken.</p></div> </div>
