<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>An ingenious form of electrolytic meter attributable to Mr. Tesla is one in which a conductor is immersed in a solution, so arranged that metal may be deposited from the solution or taken away in such a manner that the electrical resistance of the conductor is varied in a definite proportion to the strength of the current the energy of which is to be computed, whereby this variation in resistance serves as a measure of the energy and also may actuate registering mechanism, whenever the resistance rises above or falls below certain limits.</p><p>In carrying out this idea Mr. Tesla employs an electrolytic cell, through which extend two conductors parallel and in close proximity to each other. These conductors he connects in series through a resistance, but in such manner that there is an equal difference of potential between them throughout their entire extent.</p></div> </div>
