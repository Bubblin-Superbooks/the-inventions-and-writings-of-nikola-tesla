<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 294.</p><p>But let us now suppose the disc to be subdivided spirally, as indicated by the full or dotted lines, Fig. 295. The difference of potential between a point on the shaft and a point on the periphery will remain unchanged, in sign as well as in amount. The only difference will be that the resistance of the disc will be augmented and that there will be a greater fall of potential from a point on the shaft to a point on the periphery when the same current is traversing the external circuit. But since the current is forced to follow the lines of subdivision, we see that it will tend either to energize or de-energize the field, and this will depend, other things being equal, upon the direction of the lines of subdivision. If the subdivision be as indicated by the full lines in Fig.</p></div> </div>
