<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> this number, as Mr. Tesla pointed out in his first lecture, being divisible by two and three, was selected in order to make various connections for two and three-phase operations, and during Mr. Tesla's experiments was used in many ways with from two to six phases. The model, Fig. 298, consists of a magnetic frame of laminated iron with four polar projections between which an armature is supported on brass bolts passing through the frame. A great variety of armatures was used in connection with these two and other fields. Some of the armatures are shown in front on the table, Fig. 297, and several are also shown enlarged in Figs. 300 to 310. An interesting exhibit is that shown at L, Fig. 297. This is an armature of hardened steel which was used in a demonstration before the Society of Arts in Boston, by Prof. Anthony. Another curious exhibit is shown enlarged in Fig. 301.</p></div> </div>
