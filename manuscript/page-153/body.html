<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The application of the principle of this invention is not, however, confined to any particular form of machine. In Figs. 30 and 31 a generator and motor of another well-known type are shown. In Fig. 30, J J are magnets disposed in a circle and wound with coils K, which are in circuit with a generator which supplies the current that maintains the field of force. In the usual construction of these machines the armature-conductor L is carried by a suitable frame, so as to be rotated in face of the magnets J J, or between these magnets and another similar set in front of them. The magnets are energized so as to be of alternately opposite polarity throughout the series, so that as the conductor C is rotated the current impulses combine or are added to one another, those produced by the conductor in any given position being all in the same direction.</p></div> </div>
