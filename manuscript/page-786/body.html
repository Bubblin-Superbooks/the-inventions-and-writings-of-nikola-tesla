<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>But on the whole I find it preferable, when using such high frequencies, to employ only one electrode and one connecting wire. I am convinced that the illuminating device of the near future will not require for its operation more than one lead, and, at any rate, it will have no leading-in wire, since the energy required can be as well transmitted through the glass. In experimental bulbs the leading-in wire is not generally used on account of convenience, as in employing condenser coatings in the manner indicated in Fig. 151, for example, there is some difficulty in fitting the parts, but these difficulties would not exist if a great many bulbs were manufactured; otherwise the energy can be conveyed through the glass as well as through a wire, and with these high frequencies the losses are very small.</p></div> </div>
