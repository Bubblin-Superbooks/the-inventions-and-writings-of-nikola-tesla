In this case only one armature-coil, as D, is included in the line-circuit, while the other, as C, is short-circuited.</p><p>In such a disposition as that shown in Fig. 43, or where only one armature-coil is employed, the torque on the start is somewhat reduced, while the tendency to synchronism is somewhat increased. In such a disposition as shown in Fig. 46, the opposite conditions would exist. In both instances, however, there is the advantage of dispensing with one contact-ring.</p><p>Fig. 48.</p><p>In Fig. 46 the two field-coils and the armature-coil D are in multiple arc. In Fig. 47 this disposition is modified, coil D being shown in series with the two field-coils.</p></div> </div>
