<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Any one who has studied Crookes' work must have received the impression that the "radiant state" is a property of the gas inseparably connected with an extremely high degree of exhaustion. But it should be remembered that the phenomena observed in an exhausted vessel are limited to the character and capacity of the apparatus which is made use of. I think that in a bulb a molecule, or atom, does not precisely move in a straight line because it meets no obstacle, but because the velocity imparted to it is sufficient to propel it in a sensibly straight line. The mean free path is one thing, but the velocity&mdash;the energy associated with the moving body&mdash;is another, and under ordinary circumstances I believe that it is a mere question of potential or speed.</p></div> </div>
