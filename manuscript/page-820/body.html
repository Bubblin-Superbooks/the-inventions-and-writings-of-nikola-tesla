<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As a result of this kind might lead able investigators to conclusions of importance, I will describe one of the experiments performed.</p><p>It is well known that when a tube is slightly exhausted, the discharge may be passed through it in the form of a thin luminous thread. When produced with currents of low frequency, obtained from a coil operated as usual, this thread is inert. If a magnet be approached to it, the part near the same is attracted or repelled, according to the direction of the lines of force of the magnet. It occurred to me that if such a thread would be produced with currents of very high frequency, it should be more or less rigid, and as it was visible it could be easily studied. Accordingly I prepared a tube about one inch in diameter and one metre long, with outside coating at each end. The tube was exhausted to a point at which, by a little working, the thread discharge could be obtained.</p></div> </div>
