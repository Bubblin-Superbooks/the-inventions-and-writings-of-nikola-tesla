<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 225.</p><p>The previous illustrations have all shown the two branches or paths containing the translating or induction devices as in derivation one to the other; but this is not always necessary. For example, in Fig. 226, A is an alternating-current generator; B B, the line wires or circuit. At any given point in the circuit let us form two paths, as D D', and at another point two paths, as C C'. Either pair or group of paths is similar to the previous dispositions with the electrical source or induction device in one branch only, while the two groups taken together form the obvious equivalent of the cases in which an induction device or generator is included in both branches. In one of the paths, as D, are included the devices to be operated by the current. In the other branch, as D', is an induction device that opposes the current impulses of one direction and directs them through the branch D.</p></div> </div>
