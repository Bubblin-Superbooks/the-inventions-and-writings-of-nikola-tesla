This time interval, however, is limited, and the results obtained by phase difference in the operation of such devices as the Tesla alternating current motors can only be approximately realized by such means of producing or securing this difference, as above indicated, for it is desirable in such cases that there should exist between the primary and secondary currents, or those which, however produced, pass through the two circuits of the motor, a difference of phase of ninety degrees; or, in other words, the current in one circuit should be a maximum when that in the other circuit is a minimum. To attain to this condition more perfectly, an increased retardation of the secondary current is secured in the following manner:</p></div> </div>
