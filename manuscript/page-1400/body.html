The extraordinary output of the Forbes unipolar dynamo and the experience of the writer confirm this view.</p><p>Again, the facility with which such a machine may be made to excite itself is striking, but this may be due&mdash;besides to the absence of armature reaction&mdash;to the perfect smoothness of the current and non-existence of self-induction.</p><p>If the poles do not cover the disc completely on both sides, then, of course, unless the disc be properly subdivided, the machine will be very inefficient. Again, in this case there are points worthy of notice.</p></div> </div>
