To gain a wider field of action, he pushed on to Paris and there secured employment as an electrical engineer with one of the large companies in the new industry of electric lighting.</p><p>It was during this period, and as early as 1882, that he began serious and continued efforts to embody the rotating field principle in operative apparatus.
