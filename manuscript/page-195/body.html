<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It will be understood that when brought up to speed the motor will run with only one of the circuits B or C connected with the main or generator circuit, or the two circuits may be connected in series. This latter plan is preferable when a current having a high number of alternations per unit of time is employed to drive the motor. In such case the starting of the motor is more difficult, and the dead and inductive resistances must take up a considerable proportion of the electromotive force of the circuits. Generally the conditions are so adjusted that the electromotive force used in each of the motor circuits is that which is required to operate the motor when its circuits are in series. The plan followed in this case is illustrated in Fig. 39. In this instance the motor has twelve poles and the armature has polar projections D wound with closed coils E.</p></div> </div>
