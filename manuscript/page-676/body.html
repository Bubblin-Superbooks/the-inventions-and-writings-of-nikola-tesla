<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The induction coils operated from the machine are rather small, containing from 5,000 to 15,000 turns in the secondary. They are immersed in boiled-out linseed oil, contained in wooden boxes covered with zinc sheet.</p><p>I have found it advantageous to reverse the usual position of the wires, and to wind, in these coils, the primaries on the top; thus allowing the use of a much larger primary, which, of course, reduces the danger of overheating and increases the output of the coil. I make the primary on each side at least one centimetre shorter than the secondary, to prevent the breaking through on the ends, which would surely occur unless the insulation on the top of the secondary be very thick, and this, of course, would be disadvantageous.</p></div> </div>
