By subdividing the iron core electrically in this direction, the generation of these currents can be reduced to a great extent. For instance, if the length of the armature-core is twelve inches, and by a suitable construction it is subdivided electrically, so that there are in the generating direction six inches of iron and six inches of intervening air-spaces or insulating material, the waste currents will be reduced to fifty per cent.</p><p>As shown in the diagrams, the armature is constructed of thin iron discs D D D, of various diameters, fastened upon the armature-shaft in a suitable manner and arranged according to their sizes, so that a series of iron bodies, i i i, is formed, each of which diminishes in thickness from the centre toward the periphery.</p></div> </div>
