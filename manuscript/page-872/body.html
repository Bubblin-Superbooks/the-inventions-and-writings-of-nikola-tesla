<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Let the pressure increase to an enormous value, and let the flow correspondingly diminish, then such impulses&mdash;variations merely of pressure, as it were&mdash;can no doubt be transmitted through a wire even if their frequency be many hundreds of millions per second. It would, of course, be out of question to transmit such impulses through a wire immersed in a gaseous medium, even if the wire were provided with a thick and excellent insulation, for most of the energy would be lost in molecular bombardment and consequent heating. The end of the wire connected to the source would be heated, and the remote end would receive but a trifling part of the energy supplied. The prime necessity, then, if such electric impulses are to be used, is to find means to reduce as much as possible the dissipation.</p></div> </div>
