These springs l may be adjusted in their pressure by the screw m, and the spring l maybe sustained upon any suitable support. They are shown as connected with the upper end of the core of the magnet N.</p><p>Around the carbon-holding rod S, between the plates S' S2, there is a tube, R, which forms a clamp. This tube is counter-bored, as seen in the section Fig. 282, so that it bears upon the rod S at its upper end and near the middle, and at the lower end of this tubular clamp R there are armature segments r of soft iron. A frame or arm, n, extending, preferably, from the core N2, supports the lever A by a fulcrum-pin, o.</p></div> </div>
