<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Upon the fall or cessation of the current impulse that established these polarities the magnetism which lags behind the current phase, and which continues to manifest itself in the polar projections C C' and the armature, produces by repulsion a rotation of the armature. The effect is continued by each reversal of the current. What occurs in the case of one pair of pole-pieces occurs simultaneously in all, so that the tendency to rotation of the armature is measured by the sum of all the forces exerted by the pole-pieces, as above described. In this motor also the magnetic lag or effect is intensified by winding one or both cores with closed induced coils. The armature core is shown as thus wound. When closed coils are used, the cores should be laminated.</p><p>It is evident that a pulsatory as well as an alternating current might be used to drive or operate the</p></div> </div>
