<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Without much reflection one would think that in pushing so far the incandescence of the electrode it would be instantly volatilized. But after a careful consideration one would find that, theoretically, it should not occur, and in this fact&mdash;which, moreover, is experimentally demonstrated&mdash;lies principally the future value of such a lamp.</p><p>At first, when the bombardment begins, most of the work is performed on the surface of the button, but when a highly conducting photosphere is formed the button is comparatively relieved. The higher the incandescence of the photosphere, the more it approaches in conductivity to that of the electrode, and the more, therefore, the solid and the gas form one conducting body. The consequence is that the further the incandescence is forced the more work, comparatively, is performed on the gas, and the less on the electrode.</p></div> </div>
