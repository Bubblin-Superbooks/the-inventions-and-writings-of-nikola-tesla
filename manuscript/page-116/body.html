The brushes bearing on the continuous portions for taking off the alternating currents are represented by a' b' c' d'. The collecting brushes, or those which may be used to take off the direct current, are designated by M M. Two pairs of the armature coils and their commutators are shown in the figure as being utilized; but all may be utilized in a similar manner.</p></div> </div>
