If, as the current alternates, the secondaries of the two branches are alternately short-circuited, the result will be that the currents of one sign pass over one branch and those of the opposite sign over the other. The disadvantages of this arrangement, which would seem to result from the employment of sliding contacts, are in reality very slight, inasmuch as the electromotive force of the secondaries may be made exceedingly low, so that sparking at the brushes is avoided.</p><p>Fig. 223.</p><p>Fig. 223 is a diagram, partly in section, of another plan of carrying out the invention. The circuit B in this case is divided, as before, and each branch includes the coils of both the fields and revolving armatures of two induction devices.</p></div> </div>
