<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It will be seen that in both cases illustrated, the proportionality of the increase or decrease of resistance to the current strength will always be preserved, for what one conductor gains the other loses, and the resistances of the conductors C C' being small as compared with the resistances in series with them. It will be understood that after each measurement or registration of a given variation of resistance in one or both conductors, the direction of the current should be changed or the instrument reversed, so that the deposit will be taken from the conductor which has gained and added to that which has lost. This principle is capable of many modifications. For instance, since there is a section of the circuit&mdash;to wit, the conductor C or C'&mdash;that varies in resistance in proportion to the current strength, such variation may be utilized, as is done in many analogous cases, to effect the operation of various automatic devices, such as registers. It is better, however, for the sake of simplicity to compute the energy by measurements of resistance.</p></div> </div>
