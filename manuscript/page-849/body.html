<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But the particles move in straight lines because the velocity imparted to them is great, and this is due to three causes&mdash;to the great electric density, the high temperature of the small point, and the fact that the particles of the lime are easily torn and thrown off&mdash;far more easily than those of carbon. With frequencies such as we are able to obtain, the particles are bodily thrown off and projected to a considerable distance; but with sufficiently high frequencies no such thing would occur; in such case only a stress would spread or a vibration would be propagated through the bulb. It would be out of the question to reach any such frequency on the assumption that the atoms move with the speed of light; but I believe that such a thing is impossible; for this an enormous potential would be required.</p></div> </div>
