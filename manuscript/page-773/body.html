<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It is now clear that, if the potential be steady, but little loss of energy can be caused in this way, for the molecules which are nearest to the sphere, having had an additional charge imparted to them by contact, are not attracted until they have parted, if not with all, at least with most of the additional charge, which can be accomplished only after a great many collisions. From the fact, that with a steady potential there is but little loss in dry air, one must come to such a conclusion. When the potential of a sphere, instead of being steady, is alternating, the conditions are entirely different. In this case a rhythmical bombardment occurs, no matter whether the molecules, after coming in contact with the sphere, lose the imparted charge or not; what is more, if the charge is not lost, the impacts are only the more violent.</p></div> </div>
