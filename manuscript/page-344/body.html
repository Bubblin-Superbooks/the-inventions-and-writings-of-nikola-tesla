<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Such a transformer may, by properly proportioning its several elements and determining the proper relations between the primary and secondary windings, the thickness of the magnetic shield, and other conditions, be constructed to yield a constant current at all loads.</p><p>Fig. 95.</p><p>Fig. 95 is a cross-section of a transformer embodying this improvement. Fig. 96 is a similar view of a modified form of transformer, showing diagrammatically the manner of using the same.</p><p>A A is the main core of the transformer, composed of a ring of soft annealed and insulated or oxidized iron wire. Upon this core is wound the secondary circuit or coil B B. This latter is then covered with a layer or layers of annealed and insulated iron wires C C, wound in a direction at right angles to the secondary coil. Over the whole is then wound the primary coil or wire D D.</p></div> </div>
