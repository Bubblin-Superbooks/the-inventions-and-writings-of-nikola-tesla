<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Any armature&mdash;such, for instance, as a disc&mdash;mounted in this field would rotate from the pole first to exhibit its magnetism to that which exhibits it later.</p><p>It is evident that the principle here described may be carried out in conjunction with other means for securing a more favorable or efficient action of the motor. For example, the polar extensions of the sections C may be wound or surrounded by closed coils. The effect of these coils will be to still more effectively retard the magnetization of the polar extensions of C.</p></div> </div>
