<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When the desired speed is reached, switch S' is closed and the current divides between both motors. By means of switch P'' both motors may be cut out.</p><p>Figs. 81, 82, 83, 84 and 85.</p><p>In Fig. 83 the arrangement is substantially the same, except that a switch T' is placed in the circuit which includes the two circuits of the torque motor. Fig. 84 shows the two motors in series, with a shunt around both containing a switch S T. There is also a shunt around the synchronizing motor S, with a switch P'. In Fig. 85 the same disposition is shown; but each motor is provided with a shunt, in which are switches P' and T'', as shown.</p></div> </div>
