<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In Figs. 54 and 55, A designates a base or stand, and B B the supporting-frame of the motor. Bolted to the supporting-frame are two magnetic cores or pole-pieces C C', of iron or soft steel. These may be subdivided or laminated, in which case hard iron or steel plates or bars should be used, or they should be wound with closed coils. D is a circular disc armature, built up of sections or plates of iron and mounted in the frame between the pole-pieces C C', curved to conform to the circular shape thereof. This disc may be wound with a number of closed coils E. F F are the main energizing coils, supported by the supporting-frame, so as to include within their magnetizing influence both the pole-pieces C C' and the armature D. The pole-pieces C C' project out beyond the coils F F on opposite sides, as indicated in the drawings.</p></div> </div>
