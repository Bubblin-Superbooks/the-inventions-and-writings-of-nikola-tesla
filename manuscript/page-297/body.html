<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The field-coils of the torque motor are connected up in two series H and I, and the alternating current from the generator is directed through or divided between these two circuits in any manner to produce a progression of the poles or points of maximum magnetic effect. This result is secured by connecting the two motor-circuits in derivation with the circuit from the generator, inserting in one motor circuit a dead resistance and in the other a self-induction coil, by which means a difference in phase between the two divisions of the current is secured. If both motors have the same number of field poles, the torque motor for a given number of alternations will tend to run at double the speed of the other, for, assuming the connections to be such as to give the best results, its poles are divided into two series and the number of poles is virtually reduced</p></div> </div>
