By this means he secures a result similar to that which he had previously attained in other forms or types of motor in which by means of one or more alternating currents he has produced the rotation or progression of the magnetic poles.</p><p>This new mode of operation will now be described. Fig. 72 is a side elevation of such motor. Fig. 73 is a side elevation of a more practicable and efficient embodiment of the invention. Fig. 74 is a central vertical section of the same in the plane of the axis of rotation.</p></div> </div>
