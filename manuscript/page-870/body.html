In this direction some improvements have been made, but the progress is hampered by many limitations. Discarding, then, the burner, there remains the three ways first mentioned, which are essentially electrical.</p><p>Suppose the light of the immediate future to be a solid, rendered incandescent by electricity. Would it not seem that it is better to employ a small button than a frail filament? From many considerations it certainly must be concluded that a button is capable of a higher economy, assuming, of course, the difficulties connected with the operation of such a lamp to be effectively overcome. But to light such a lamp we require a high potential; and to get this economically, we must use high frequencies.</p></div> </div>
