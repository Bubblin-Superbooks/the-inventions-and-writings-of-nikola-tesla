Besides, these transformers are expensive to build. It has been found by experience that it is best to follow the plan illustrated at IIIa. In this arrangement a rotating transformer g, is employed to convert the low tension direct currents into low frequency alternating currents, preferably also of small tension. The tension of the currents is then raised in a stationary transformer T. The secondary S of this transformer is connected to an adjustable condenser C which discharges through the gap or discharger d d, placed in either of the ways indicated, through the primary P of a disruptive discharge coil, the high frequency current being obtained from the secondary S of this coil, as described on previous occasions. This will undoubtedly be found the cheapest and most convenient way of converting direct currents.</p></div> </div>
