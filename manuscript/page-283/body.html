<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It will have been gathered by all who are interested in the advance of the electrical arts, and who follow carefully, step by step, the work of pioneers, that Mr. Tesla has been foremost to utilize inductive effects in permanently closed circuits, in the operation of alternating motors. In this chapter one simple type of such a motor is described and illustrated, which will serve as an exemplification of the principle.</p><p>Let it be assumed that an ordinary alternating current generator is connected up in a circuit of practically no self-induction, such, for example, as a circuit containing incandescent lamps only. On the operation of the machine, alternating currents will be developed in the circuit, and the phases of these currents will theoretically coincide with the phases of the impressed electromotive force. Such currents may be regarded and designated as the "unretarded currents."</p></div> </div>
