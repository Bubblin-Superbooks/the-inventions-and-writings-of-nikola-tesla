<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If a luminous discharge is produced in a closed exhausted tube, do the atoms arrange themselves in obedience to any other but to electrostatic force acting in straight lines from atom to atom? Only recently I investigated the mutual action between two circuits with extreme rates of vibration. When a battery of a few jars (c c c c, Fig. 196) is discharged through a primary P of low resistance (the connections being as illustrated in Figs. 183a, 183b and 183c), and the frequency of vibration is many millions there are great differences of potential between points on the primary not more than a few inches apart. These differences may be 10,000 volts per inch, if not more, taking the maximum value of the e. m. f. The secondary s is therefore acted upon by electrostatic induction, which is in such extreme cases of much greater importance than the electro-dynamic.</p></div> </div>
