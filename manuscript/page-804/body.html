<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This arrangement overcomes the imperfections and troubles which often arise from the use of the stopcock on the reservoir and the connections of the latter with the fall tube.</p><p>The pump is connected through a U-shaped tube t to a very large reservoir R1. Especial care was taken in fitting the grinding surfaces of the stoppers p and p1, and both of these and the mercury caps above them were made exceptionally long. After the U-shaped tube was fitted and put in place, it was heated, so as to soften and take off the strain resulting from imperfect fitting. The U-shaped tube was provided with a stopcock C, and two ground connections g and g1,&mdash;one for a small bulb b, usually containing caustic potash, and the other for the receiver r, to be exhausted.</p></div> </div>
