When one of the ends of the primary coil of the motor is connected to one of the terminals of the high frequency coil and the other end to an insulated metal plate, which, it should be stated, is not absolutely necessary for the success of the experiment, the disc is set in rotation.</p><p>Experiments of this kind seem to bring it within possibility to operate a motor at any point of the earth's surface from a central source, without any connection to the same except through the earth. If, by means of powerful machinery, rapid variations of the earth's potential were produced, a grounded wire reaching up to some height would be traversed by a current which could be increased by connecting the free end of the wire to a body of some size. The current might be converted to low tension and used to operate a motor or other device.</p></div> </div>
