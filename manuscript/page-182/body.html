<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 41.</p><p>When the motor has attained the desired speed, the switch is shifted to the position shown in dotted lines&mdash;that is to say, with the levers f g resting on points c e. This connects up the two armature coils in series, and the motor will then run as a synchronous motor. The field-coils are thrown into circuit with the direct current source when the main switch is shifted.</p></div> </div>
