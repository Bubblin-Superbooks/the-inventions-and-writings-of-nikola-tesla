<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 60.Fig. 61.</p><p>Fig. 60 is a view in side elevation of a motor embodying the principle. Fig. 61 is a vertical cross-section of the motor. A is the frame of the motor, which should be built up of sheets of iron punched out to the desired shape and bolted together with insulation between the sheets. When complete, the frame makes a field-magnet with inwardly projecting pole-pieces B and C. To adapt them to the requirements of this particular case these pole-pieces are out of line with one another, those marked B surrounding one end of the armature and the others, as C, the opposite end, and they are disposed alternately&mdash;that is to say, the pole-pieces of one set occur in line with the spaces between those of the other sets.</p></div> </div>
