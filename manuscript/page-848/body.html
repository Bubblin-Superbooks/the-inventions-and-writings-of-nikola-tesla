<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The degree of exhaustion is just such that with the potential the coil is capable of giving, phosphorescence of the glass is produced, but disappears as soon as the vacuum is impaired. The lime containing moisture, and moisture being given off as soon as heating occurs, the phosphorescence lasts only for a few moments. When the lime has been sufficiently heated, enough moisture has been given off to impair materially the vacuum of the bulb. As the bombardment goes on, one point of the lime piece is more heated than other points, and the result is that finally practically all the discharge passes through that point which is intensely heated, and a white stream of lime particles (Fig. 160) then breaks forth from that point. This stream is composed of "radiant" matter, yet the degree of exhaustion is low.</p></div> </div>
