When this is done, the currents are produced by dynamo-magnetic induction only, the same result being obtained as though the poles were shifted by a commutator with an infinite number of segments.</p><p>The modifications which are applicable to other forms of converter are in many respects applicable to this, such as those pertaining more particularly to the form of the core, the relative lengths and resistances of the primary and secondary coils, and the arrangements for running or operating the same.</p></div> </div>
