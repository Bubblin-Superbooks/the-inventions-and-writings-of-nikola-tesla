<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Such a tube might be placed around a hall or on a ceiling, and at once a simple appliance capable of giving considerable light would be obtained. But this would be an appliance hard to manufacture and extremely unmanageable. It would not do to make the tube up of small lengths, because there would be with ordinary frequencies considerable loss in the coatings, and besides, if coatings were used, it would be better to supply the current directly to the tube by connecting the coatings to a transformer. But even if all objections of such nature were removed, with low frequencies the light conversion itself would be inefficient, as I have before stated. In using extremely high frequencies the length of the secondary&mdash;in other words, the size of the vessel&mdash;can be reduced as much as desired, and the efficiency of the light conversion is increased, provided that means are invented for efficiently obtaining such high frequencies.</p></div> </div>
