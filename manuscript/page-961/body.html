But this rule may be taken to be true only in a general way, when comparing rates which are widely different.</p><p>Fig. 170a.Fig. 170b.</p><p>I will show you by an experiment the difference in the effect produced by a rapidly varying and a steady or moderately varying force. I have here two large circular brass plates p p (Fig. 170a and Fig. 170b), supported on movable insulating stands on the table, connected to the ends of the secondary of a coil similar to the one used before. I place the plates ten or twelve inches apart and set the coil to work. You see the whole space between the plates, nearly two cubic feet, filled with uniform light, Fig. 170a.</p></div> </div>
