<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A shield, R, is connected with the magnet-core and swings with it, so that after the heat has demagnetized the armature A to such an extent that the spring W draws the core N S away from the armature A, the shield R comes between the flame H and armature A, thereby intercepting the action of the heat and allowing the armature to cool, so that the magnetism, again preponderating, causes the movement of the core N S toward the armature A and the removal of the shield R from above the flame, so that the heat again acts to lessen or neutralize the magnetism. A rotary or other movement may be obtained from this reciprocation.</p><p>Fig. 234 corresponds in every respect with Fig. 233, except that a permanent horseshoe-magnet, N S is represented as taking the place of the electro-magnet in Fig. 233.</p></div> </div>
