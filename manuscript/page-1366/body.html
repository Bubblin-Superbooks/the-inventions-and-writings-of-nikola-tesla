The magnetism of the pole piece e tends to hold the lever A level, or nearly so, the core N2 being energized by the current in the shunt which contains the helix N. In this position the lever A is not moved by any ordinary variation in the current, because the armature b is strongly attracted by the magnetism of e, and these parts are close to each other, and the magnetism of e acts at right angles to the magnetism of the core M'.</p></div> </div>
