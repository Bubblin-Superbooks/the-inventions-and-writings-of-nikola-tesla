In various experiments this machine has been run as high as 3,000 revolutions per minute. Owing to the great speed it was possible to obtain as high as 10 amperes out of the machine. The electromotive force was regulated by means of an adjustable condenser within very wide limits, the limits being the greater, the greater the speed. This machine was frequently used to run Mr. Tesla's laboratory lights.</p><p>The machine above described was only one of many such types constructed. It serves well for an experimental machine, but if still higher alternations are required and higher efficiency is necessary, then a machine on a plan shown in Figs. 204 to 207, is preferable.</p></div> </div>
