<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> By the alternations of current, other currents are induced in the closed&mdash;or short-circuited&mdash;armature coils and the motor has a strong torque. When the desired speed is reached, the shunt around the armature-coils is opened and the current directed through both armature and field coils. Under these conditions the motor has a strong tendency to synchronism.</p><p>Figs. 49, 50 and 51.</p><p>In Fig. 49, A and B designate the field coils of the motor. As the circuits including these coils are of different self-induction, this is represented by a resistance coil R in circuit with A, and a self-induction coil S in circuit with B. The same result may of course be secured by the winding of the coils. C is the armature circuit, the terminals of which are rings a b. Brushes c d bear on these rings and connect with the line and field circuits. D is the shunt or short circuit around the armature. E is the switch in the shunt.</p></div> </div>
