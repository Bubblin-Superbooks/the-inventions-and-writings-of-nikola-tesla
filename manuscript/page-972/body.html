<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In view of the present state of the art it is thought sufficient to describe these arrangements in a few words only. The diagram, Fig. 180 II., shows a primary coil P, connected with one of its ends to the line L leading from a high tension transformer terminal T1. In inductive relation to this primary P is a secondary S of coarse wire in the circuit of which is a coil c. The currents induced in the secondary energize the iron core i, which is preferably, but not necessarily, subdivided, and set the metal disc d in rotation. Such a motor M2 as diagramatically shown in Fig. 180 II., has been called a "magnetic lag motor," but this expression may be objected to by those who attribute the rotation of the disc to eddy currents circulating in minute paths when the core i is finally subdivided.</p></div> </div>
