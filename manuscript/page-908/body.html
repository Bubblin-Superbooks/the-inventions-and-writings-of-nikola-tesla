One of these dischargers is illustrated in Figs. 168a and 168b.</p><p>.Fig. 168b.</p><p>A hollow metal pulley P (Fig. 168a), was fastened upon an arbor a, which by suitable means was rotated at a considerable speed. On the inside of the pulley, but disconnected from the same, was supported a thin disc h (which is shown thick for the sake of clearness), of hard rubber in which there were embedded two metal segments s s with metallic extensions e e into which were screwed conducting terminals t t covered with thick tubes of hard rubber t t. The rubber disc h with its metallic segments s s, was finished in a lathe, and its entire surface highly polished so as to offer the smallest possible frictional resistance to the motion through a fluid.</p></div> </div>
