<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A flexible metallic belt L is passed over the flanges of the two discs, and, if desired, may be used to drive one of the discs. It is better, however, to use this belt merely as a conductor, and for this purpose sheet steel, copper, or other suitable metal is used. Each shaft is provided with a driving pulley M, by which power is imparted from a driving shaft.</p><p>N N are the terminals. For the sake of clearness they are shown as provided with springs P, that bear upon the ends of the shafts. This machine, if self-exciting, would have copper bands around its poles; or conductors of any kind&mdash;such as wires shown in the drawings&mdash;may be used.</p></div> </div>
