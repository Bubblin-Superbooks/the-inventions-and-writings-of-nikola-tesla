<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A smaller ring, shown at B, was arranged like the one exhibited at A but designed especially to exhibit the rotation of an armature in a rotating field. In connection with these two rings there was an interesting exhibit shown by Mr. Tesla which consisted of a magnet with a coil, the magnet being arranged to rotate in bearings. With this magnet he first demonstrated the identity between a rotating field and a rotating magnet; the latter, when rotating, exhibited the same phenomena as the rings when they were energized by currents of differing phase. Another prominent exhibit was a model illustrated at C which is a two-phase motor, as well as an induction motor and transformer. It consists of a large outer ring of laminated iron wound with two superimposed, separated windings which can be connected in a variety of ways.</p></div> </div>
