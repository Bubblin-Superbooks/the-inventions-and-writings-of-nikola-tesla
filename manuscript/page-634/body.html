In this case the arc is preferably established between the knobs A B, in Fig. 131 (the knobs a b being generally joined, or entirely done away with), as in this disposition the arc is long and unsteady, and is easily affected by the draught.</p><p>When a magnet is employed to break the arc, it is better to choose the connection indicated diagrammatically in Fig. 134, as in this case the currents forming the arc are much more powerful, and the magnetic field exercises a greater influence. The use of the magnet permits, however, of the arc being replaced by a vacuum tube, but I have encountered great difficulties in working with an exhausted tube.</p></div> </div>
