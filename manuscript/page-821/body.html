<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It must be remarked here that the general aspect of the tube, and the degree of exhaustion, are quite other than when ordinary low frequency currents are used. As it was found preferable to work with one terminal, the tube prepared was suspended from the end of a wire connected to the terminal, the tinfoil coating being connected to the wire, and to the lower coating sometimes a small insulated plate was attached. When the thread was formed, it extended through the upper part of the tube and lost itself in the lower end. If it possessed rigidity it resembled, not exactly an elastic cord stretched tight between two supports, but a cord suspended from a height with a small weight attached at the end. When the finger or a small magnet was approached to the upper end of the luminous thread, it could be brought locally out of position by electrostatic or magnetic action;</p></div> </div>
