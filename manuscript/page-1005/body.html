<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It is thought useful to devote here a few remarks to the subject of operating devices of all kinds by means of only one leading wire. It is quite obvious, that when high-frequency currents are made use of, ground connections are&mdash;at least when the e. m. f. of the currents is great&mdash;better than a return wire. Such ground connections are objectionable with steady or low frequency currents on account of destructive chemical actions of the former and disturbing influences exerted by both on the neighboring circuits; but with high frequencies these actions practically do not exist. Still, even ground connections become superfluous when the e. m. f. is very high, for soon a condition is reached, when the current may be passed more economically through open, than through closed, conductors.</p></div> </div>
