<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Within the influence of this field is an armature core D, wound with coils E. In motors of this description heretofore these coils have been closed upon themselves, or connected in a closed series; but in the present case each coil or the connected series of coils terminates in the opposite plates of a condenser F. For this purpose the ends of the series of coils are brought out through the shaft to collecting rings G, which are connected to the condenser by contact brushes H and suitable conductors, the condenser being independent of the machine. The armature coils are wound or connected in such manner that adjacent coils produce opposite poles.</p><p>The action of this motor and the effect of the plan followed in its construction are as follows:</p></div> </div>
