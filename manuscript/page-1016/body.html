<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Should, as the majority of scientific men in all probability believe, the period be extremely small, then a dynamo machine would not do and a proper electrical oscillator would have to be produced and perhaps it might not be possible to obtain such rapid vibrations. But whether this be possible or not, and whether the earth contains a charge or not, and whatever may be its period of vibration, it certainly is possible&mdash;for of this we have daily evidence&mdash;to produce some electrical disturbance sufficiently powerful to be perceptible by suitable instruments at any point of the earth's surface.</p><p>Assume that a source of alternating current S be connected, as in Fig. 185, with one of its terminals to earth (conveniently to the water mains) and with the other to a body of large surface P.</p></div> </div>
