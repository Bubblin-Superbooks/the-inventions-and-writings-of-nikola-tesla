The importance of the action of the air is particularly illustrated by an interesting experiment.</p><p>Taking up another class of phenomena, namely, those of dynamic electricity, Mr. Tesla produced in a number of experiments a variety of effects by the employment of only a single wire with the evident intent of impressing upon his audience the idea that electric vibration or current can be transmitted with ease, without any return circuit; also how currents so transmitted can be converted and used for many practical purposes. A number of experiments are then shown, illustrating the effects of frequency, self-induction and capacity; then a number of ways of operating motive and other devices by the use of a single lead. A number of novel impedance phenomena are also shown which cannot fail to arouse interest.</p></div> </div>
