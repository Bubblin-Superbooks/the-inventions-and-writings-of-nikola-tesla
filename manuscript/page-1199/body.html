One of the generators or sources of current E or F may be dispensed with; but it is preferable to employ both, if they offer an appreciable resistance, as the two branches will be thereby better balanced. The translating or other devices to be acted upon by the current are designated by the letters G, and they are inserted in the branches C D in any desired manner; but in order to better preserve an even balance between the branches due regard should, of course, be had to the number and character of the devices.</p><p>Figs. 221, 222, 223, and 224 illustrate what may termed "electro-magnetic" devices for accomplishing a similar result&mdash;</p></div> </div>
