<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The electrical connections are as indicated diagrammatically in Fig. 289. The wire in the main magnet consists of two parts, x' and p'. These two parts may be in two separated coils or in one single helix, as shown in the drawings. The part x' being normally in circuit, is, with the fine wire upon the shunt-magnet, wound and traversed by the current in the same direction, so as to tend to produce similar poles, N N or S S, on the corresponding pole-pieces of the magnets M and N. The part p' is only in circuit when the lamp is cut out, and then the current being in the opposite direction produces in the main magnet, magnetism of the opposite polarity.</p></div> </div>
