It also follows, as a matter of course, that if the number of the poles of the motor be greater than that of the generator the motor will revolve at a slower speed than the generator.</p><p>In this chapter, we may include a method devised by Mr. Tesla for avoiding the very high speeds which would be necessary with large generators. In lieu of revolving the generator armature at a high rate of speed, he secures the desired result by a rotation of the magnetic poles of one element of the generator, while driving the other at a different speed. The effect is the same as that yielded by a very high rate of rotation.</p></div> </div>
