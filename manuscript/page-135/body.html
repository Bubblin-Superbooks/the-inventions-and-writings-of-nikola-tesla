<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There may be an armature, E, within the ring, which is wound with coils closed upon themselves. The object is to pass through coils C D currents of such relative strength and direction as to produce a progressive shifting or movement of the points of maximum magnetic effect around the ring, and to thereby maintain a rotary movement of the armature. There are therefore secured to the shaft F of the generator, four insulated contact-rings, a b c d, upon which bear the collecting-brushes a' b' c' d', connected by wires G G H H, respectively, with the terminals of coils C and D.</p><p>Assume, for sake of illustration, that the coils D D are to receive the maximum and coils C C at the same instant the minimum current, so that the polar line may be midway between the coils D D.</p></div> </div>
