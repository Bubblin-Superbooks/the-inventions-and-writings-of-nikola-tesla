<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The tube T, with the small tubes, wires through the same, and the refractory buttons m and m1, were first prepared, and then sealed to globe L, whereupon the coil C was slipped in and the connections made to its ends. The tube was then packed with insulating powder, jamming the latter as tight as possible up to very nearly the end; then it was closed and only a small hole left through which the remainder of the powder was introduced, and finally the end of the tube was closed. Usually in bulbs constructed as shown in Fig. 162 an aluminum tube a was fastened to the upper end s of each of the tubes t and t1 in order to protect that end against the heat. The buttons m and m1 could be brought to any degree of incandescence by passing the discharges of Leyden jars around the coil C. In such bulbs with two buttons a very curious effect is produced by the formation of the shadows of each of the two buttons.</p></div> </div>
