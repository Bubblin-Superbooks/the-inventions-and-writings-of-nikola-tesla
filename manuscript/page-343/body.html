<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To either of the condensers above described the armature coils may be connected, as explained by reference to Fig. 86.</p><p>In motors in which the armature coils are closed upon themselves&mdash;as, for example, in any form of alternating current motor in which one armature coil or set of coils is in the position of maximum induction with respect to the field coils or poles, while the other is in the position of minimum induction&mdash;the coils are best connected in one series, and two points of the circuit thus formed are bridged by a condenser. This is illustrated in Fig. 90, in which E represents one set of armature coils and E' the other. Their points of union are joined through a condenser F. It will be observed that in this disposition the self-induction of the two branches E and E' varies with their position relatively to the field magnet, and that each branch is alternately the predominating source of the induced current.</p></div> </div>
