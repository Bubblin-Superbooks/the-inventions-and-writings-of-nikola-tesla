<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The dash-pot connected to the iron core I may be of ordinary construction; but it is better, especially in machines for arc lights, to provide the piston of the dash-pot with a valve, as indicated in the diagrams. This valve permits a comparatively easy downward movement of the iron core, but checks its movement when it is drawn up by the solenoid. Such an arrangement has the advantage that a great number of lights may be put on without diminishing the light-power of the lamps in the circuit, as the brushes assume at once the proper position. When lights are cut out, the dash-pot acts to retard the movement; but if the current is considerably increased the solenoid gets abnormally strong and the brushes are shifted instantly. The regulator being properly adjusted, lights or other devices may be put on or out with scarcely any perceptible difference. It is obvious that instead of the dash-pot any other retarding device may be used.</p></div> </div>
