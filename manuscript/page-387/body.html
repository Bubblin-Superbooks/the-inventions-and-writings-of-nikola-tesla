<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This Royal Institution lecture summed up the leading points of Mr. Tesla's work, in the high potential, high frequency field, and we may here avail ourselves of so valuable a summarization, in a simple form, of a subject by no means easy of comprehension until it has been thoroughly studied.</p><p>In these London lectures, among the many notable points made was first, the difficulty of constructing the alternators to obtain the very high frequencies needed. To obtain the high frequencies it was necessary to provide several hundred polar projections, which were necessarily small and offered many drawbacks, and this the more as exceedingly high peripheral speeds had to be resorted to. In some of the first machines both armature and field had polar projections. These machines produced a curious noise, especially when the armature was started from the state of rest, the field being charged.</p></div> </div>
