<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Furthermore I have observed that there is a molecular bombardment in the plane of the luminous circle at right angles to the glass&mdash;supposing the circle to be in the plane of the primary&mdash;this bombardment being evident from the rapid heating of the glass near the primary. Were the bombardment not at right angles to the glass the heating could not be so rapid. If there is a circumferential movement of the molecules constituting the luminous circle, I have thought that it might be rendered manifest by placing within the tube or bulb, radially to the circle, a thin plate of mica coated with some phosphorescent material and another such plate tangentially to the circle. If the molecules would move circumferentially, the former plate would be rendered more intensely phosphorescent. For want of time I have, however, not been able to perform the experiment.</p></div> </div>
