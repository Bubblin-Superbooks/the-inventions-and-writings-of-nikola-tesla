The experimenter may vary them in many ways, and, if it were for nothing else, they afford a pleasing sight. What adds to their interest is that they may be produced with one single terminal as well as with two&mdash;in fact, often better with one than with two.</p><p>But of all the discharge phenomena observed, the most pleasing to the eye, and the most instructive, are those observed with a coil which is operated by means of the disruptive discharge of a condenser. The power of the brushes, the abundance of the sparks, when the conditions are patiently adjusted, is often amazing. With even a very small coil, if it be so well insulated as to stand a difference of potential of several thousand volts per turn, the sparks may be so abundant that the whole coil may appear a complete mass of fire.</p></div> </div>
