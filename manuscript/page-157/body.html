This regulator, however, has another valuable property in its capability of reversing the motor, for if the coil F be turned through a half-revolution, the position of its convolutions relatively to the two coils C C and to the lines of force is reversed, and consequently the phases of the current will be reversed. This will produce a rotation of the motor in an opposite direction. This form of regulator is also applied with great advantage to Mr. Tesla's system of utilizing alternating currents, in which the magnetic poles of the field of a motor are progressively shifted by means of the combined effects upon the field of magnetizing coils included in independent circuits, through which pass alternating currents in proper order and relations to each other.</p></div> </div>
