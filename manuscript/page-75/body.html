<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 4.</p><p>Fig. 4a.</p><p>Fig. 4 shows the coils C C in a still more advanced position, the armature having completed three-eighths of one revolution. At that moment the coil C still generates a current of the same direction as before, but of less strength, producing the comparatively weaker poles n s in Fig. 4a. The current in the coil C1 is of the same strength, but opposite direction. Its effect is, therefore, to produce upon the ring the poles n1 s1, as indicated, and a polarity, N S, results, the poles now being shifted three-eighths of the periphery of the ring.</p><p>Fig. 5.</p><p>Fig. 5a.</p></div> </div>
