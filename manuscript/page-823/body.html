Thus, either increasing the frequency or passing a stronger discharge of the same frequency corresponded to a tightening of the cord. I did not obtain any experimental evidence with condenser discharges. A luminous band excited in the bulb by repeated discharges of a Leyden jar must possess rigidity, and if deformed and suddenly released, should vibrate. But probably the amount of vibrating matter is so small that in spite of the extreme speed, the inertia cannot prominently assert itself. Besides, the observation in such a case is rendered extremely difficult on account of the fundamental vibration.</p><p>The demonstration of the fact&mdash;which still needs better experimental confirmation&mdash;</p></div> </div>
