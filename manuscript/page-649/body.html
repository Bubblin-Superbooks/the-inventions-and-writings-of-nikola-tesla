<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 138.</p><p>Here, for instance, I have two plates, R R, of hard rubber (Fig. 138), upon which I have glued two very thin wires w w, so as to form a name. The wires may be bare or covered with the best insulation&mdash;it is immaterial for the success of the experiment. Well insulated wires, if anything, are preferable. On the back of each plate, indicated by the shaded portion, is a tinfoil coating t t. The plates are placed in line at a sufficient distance to prevent a spark passing from one wire to the other. The two tinfoil coatings I have joined by a conductor C, and the two wires I presently connect to the terminals of the coil.</p></div> </div>
