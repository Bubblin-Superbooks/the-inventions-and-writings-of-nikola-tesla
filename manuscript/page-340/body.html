<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mr. Tesla has applied his principle of magnetic shielding of parts to the construction also of transformers, the shield being interposed between the primary and secondary coils. In transformers of the ordinary type it will be found that the wave of electromotive force of the secondary very nearly coincides with that of the primary, being, however, in opposite sign. At the same time the currents, both primary and secondary, lag behind their respective electromotive forces; but as this lag is practically or nearly the same in the case of each it follows that the maximum and minimum of the primary and secondary currents will nearly coincide, but differ in sign or direction, provided the secondary be not loaded or if it contain devices having the property of self-induction. On the other hand, the lag of the primary behind the impressed electromotive force may be diminished by loading the secondary with a non-inductive or dead resistance&mdash;</p></div> </div>
