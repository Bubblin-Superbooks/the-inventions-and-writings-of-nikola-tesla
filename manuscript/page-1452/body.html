<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Imagine that the motion of the conductor is arrested by the current generated, and that at the instant when it stops to move into the field, there is still the maximum current flowing in the conductor; then this current will, according to Lenz's law, drive the conductor out of the field again, and if the conductor has no resistance, then it would leave the field with the velocity it entered it. Now it is clear that if, instead of simply depending on the current to drive the conductor out of the field, the mechanically applied force is so timed that it helps the conductor to get out of the field, then it might leave the field with higher velocity than it entered it, and thus one impulse is made to preponderate in e. m. f. over the other.</p></div> </div>
