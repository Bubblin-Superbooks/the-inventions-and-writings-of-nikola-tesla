<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 91 illustrates the invention as embodied in a motor in which the inductive relation of the primary and secondary circuits is secured by winding them inside the motor partly upon the same cores; but the invention applies, generally, to other forms of motor in which one of the energizing currents is induced in any way from the other.</p><p>Let A B represent the poles of an alternating current motor, of which C is the armature wound with coils D, closed upon themselves, as is now the general practice in motors of this kind. The poles A, which alternate with poles B, are wound with coils of ordinary or coarse wire E in such direction as to make them of alternate north and south polarity, as indicated in the diagram by the characters N S. Over these coils, or in other inductive relation to the same, are wound long fine-wire coils F F, and in the same direction throughout as the coils E.</p></div> </div>
