<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>An interesting device for regulating and reversing has been devised by Mr. Tesla for the purpose of varying the speed of polyphase motors. It consists of a form of converter or transformer with one element capable of movement with respect to the other, whereby the inductive relations may be altered, either manually or automatically, for the purpose of varying the strength of the induced current. Mr. Tesla prefers to construct this device in such manner that the induced or secondary element may be movable with respect to the other; and the invention, so far as relates merely to the construction of the device itself, consists, essentially, in the combination, with two opposite magnetic poles, of an armature wound with an insulated coil and mounted on a shaft, whereby it may be turned to the desired extent within the field produced by the poles.</p></div> </div>
