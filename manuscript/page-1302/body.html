<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This diminishes the strength of the current until the opposing forces are balanced and the solenoid is traversed by the normal current; but if from any cause the current in the circuit is diminished, then the weight of the moving parts overcomes the pull of the solenoid, the iron core I descends, thus shifting the brushes the opposite way and increasing the current to the normal strength. The dash-pot connected to the iron core I may be of ordinary construction; but it is better, especially in machines for arc lights, to provide the piston of the dash-pot with a valve, as indicated in the diagrams. This valve permits a comparatively easy downward movement of the iron core, but checks its movement when it is drawn up by the solenoid. Such an arrangement has the advantage that a great number of lights may be put on without diminishing the light-power of the lamps in the circuit, as the brushes assume at once the proper position.</p></div> </div>
