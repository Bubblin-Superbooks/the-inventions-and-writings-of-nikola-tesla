But place a gaseous (or liquid) column in an intense, rapidly alternating electrostatic field, set the particles vibrating with enormous speeds, then the inertia resistance asserts itself. A body might move with more or less freedom through the vibrating mass, but as a whole it would be rigid.</p><p>There is a subject which I must mention in connection with these experiments: it is that of high vacua. This is a subject, the study of which is not only interesting, but useful, for it may lead to results of great practical importance.</p></div> </div>
