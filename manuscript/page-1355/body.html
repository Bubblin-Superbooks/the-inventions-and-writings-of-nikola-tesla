This difficulty is most apparent when there are only a few lamps in circuit. To lessen this difficulty lamps have been constructed in which the lever or armature, after the establishing of the arc, is kept in a fixed position and cannot vibrate during the feed operation, the feed mechanism acting independently;</p></div> </div>
