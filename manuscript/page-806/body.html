<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The capacity of the pump and of the connections was taken as small as possible relatively to the volume of reservoir, R1, since, of course, the degree of exhaustion depended upon the ratio of these quantities.</p><p>With this apparatus I combined the usual means indicated by former experiments for the production of very high vacua. In most of the experiments it was most convenient to use caustic potash. I may venture to say, in regard to its use, that much time is saved and a more perfect action of the pump insured by fusing and boiling the potash as soon as, or even before, the pump settles down. If this course is not followed, the sticks, as ordinarily employed, may give off moisture at a certain very slow rate, and the pump may work for many hours without reaching a very high vacuum.</p></div> </div>
