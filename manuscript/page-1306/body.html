The parts M and M' of the field wire may be wound in the same direction. In this case they are arranged as shown in Fig. 253; or the part M may be wound in the opposite direction, as shown in Figs. 254 and 255.</p><p>Fig. 254.</p><p>It will be apparent that the respective cores of the field-magnets are subjected to neutralizing or intensifying effects of the current in the shunt through c', and the magnetism of the cores will be partially neutralized, or the points of greatest magnetism shifted, so that it will be more or less remote from or approaching to the armature, and hence the aggregate energizing actions of the field magnets on the armature will be correspondingly varied.</p></div> </div>
