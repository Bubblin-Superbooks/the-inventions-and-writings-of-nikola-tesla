<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> According to this view, a coil operated by disruptive discharge would be eminently adapted to produce such a result, and it is found by experience that its power of exciting phosphorescence is extraordinarily great. It is capable of exciting phosphorescence at comparatively low degrees of exhaustion, and also projects shadows at pressures far greater than those at which the mean free path is comparable to the dimensions of the vessel. The latter observation is of some importance, inasmuch as it may modify the generally accepted views in regard to the "radiant state" phenomena.</p><p>A thought which early and naturally suggested itself to Mr. Tesla, was to utilize the great inductive effects of high frequency currents to produce light in a sealed glass vessel without the use of leading in wires. Accordingly, many bulbs were constructed in which the energy necessary to maintain a button or filament at high incandescence, was supplied through the glass by either electrostatic or electrodynamic induction.</p></div> </div>
