<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Figs. 45, 46 and 47.</p><p>Fig. 43 shows a somewhat modified arrangement of circuits. There is in this case but one armature coil E, the winding of which maintains effects corresponding to the resultant poles produced by the two field-circuits.</p><p>Fig. 44 represents a disposition in which both armature and field are wound with two sets of coils, all in multiple arc to the line or main circuit. The armature coils are wound to correspond with the field-coils with respect to their self-induction. A modification of this plan is shown in Fig. 45&mdash;that is to say, the two field coils and two armature coils are in derivation to themselves and in series with one another. The armature coils in this case, as in the previous figure, are wound for different self-induction to correspond with the field coils.</p></div> </div>
