<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Assuming that the motor is a synchronizing motor or one that has the capability of running in synchronism with the generator, but not of starting, it may be started by the above-described apparatus by closing the ground connection from both generator and motor. The system thus becomes one with a two-circuit generator and motor, the ground forming a common return for the currents in the two circuits L and L'. When by this arrangement of circuits the motor is brought to speed, the ground connection is broken between the motor or generator, or both, ground-switches P P' being employed for this purpose. The motor then runs as a synchronizing motor.</p><p>In describing the main features which constitute this invention illustrations have necessarily been omitted of the appliances used in conjunction with the electrical devices of similar systems&mdash;</p></div> </div>
