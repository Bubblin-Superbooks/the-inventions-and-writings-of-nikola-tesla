<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 34.</p><p>Fig. 35.</p><p>In Fig. 36 let H represent an ordinary alternating current generator, the field-magnets of which are excited by a suitable source of current, I. Let J designate an ordinary form of electromagnetic motor provided with an armature, K, commutator L, and field-magnets M. It is well known that such a motor, if its field-magnet cores be divided up into insulated sections, may be practically operated by an alternating current; but in using this regulator with such a motor, Mr. Tesla includes one element of the motor only&mdash;say the armature-coils&mdash;in the main circuit of the generator, making the connections through the brushes and the commutator in the usual way. He also includes one of the elements of the regulator&mdash;say the stationary coils&mdash;in the same circuit, and in the circuit with the secondary or movable coil of the regulator he connects up the field-coils of the motor.</p></div> </div>
