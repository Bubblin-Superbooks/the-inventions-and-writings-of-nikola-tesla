<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When all the three bulbs were connected in multiple arc to the coil, in the largest of them the filament glowed brightest, in the next smaller it was a little less bright, and in the smallest it only came to redness. The bulbs were then sealed off and separately tried. The brightness of the filaments was now such as would have been expected on the supposition that the energy given off was proportionate to the surface of the bulb, this surface in each case representing one of the coatings of a condenser. Accordingly, there was less difference between the largest and the middle sized than between the latter and the smallest bulb.</p><p>An interesting observation was made in this experiment. The three bulbs were suspended from a straight bare wire connected to a terminal of a coil, the largest bulb being placed at the end of the wire, at some distance from it the smallest bulb, and at an equal distance from the latter the middle-sized one.</p></div> </div>
