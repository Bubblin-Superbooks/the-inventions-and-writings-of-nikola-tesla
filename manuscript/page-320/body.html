<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Hence the effect of the condenser F is twofold. First, it increases the current in each of the branches alternately, and, secondly, it alters the phase of the currents in the branches, this being the well-known effect which results from such a disposition of a condenser with a circuit, as above described. This effect is favorable to the proper working of the motor, because it increases the flow of current in the armature circuits due to a given inductive effect, and also because it brings more nearly into coincidence the maximum magnetic effects of the coacting field and armature poles.</p><p>It will be understood, of course, that the causes that contribute to the efficiency of condensers when applied to such uses as the above must be given due consideration in determining the practicability and efficiency of the motors.</p></div> </div>
