<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 77.</p><p>Inasmuch as neither motor is doing any work while the current is acting upon the other, the two armatures are rigidly connected, both being mounted upon the same shaft A, the field-magnets B of the synchronizing and C of the torque motor being secured to the same base D. The preferably larger synchronizing motor has polar projections on its armature, which rotate in very close proximity to the poles of the field, and in other respects it conforms to the conditions that are necessary to secure synchronous action. The pole-pieces of the armature are, however, wound with closed coils E, as this obviates the employment of sliding contacts. The smaller or torque motor, on the other hand, has, preferably, a cylindrical armature F, without polar projections and wound with closed coils G.</p></div> </div>
