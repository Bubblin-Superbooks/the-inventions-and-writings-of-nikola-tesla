The cylindrical armature H of the motor is wound with two coils at right angles, which form independent closed circuits.</p><p>If transformers be employed, one set of the primary coils, as N N, wound on a ring or annular core is connected to one circuit, as M', and the other primary coils, N N', to the circuit M. The secondary coils K K' may then be utilized for running groups of incandescent lamps P P'.</p><p>Fig. 33.</p></div> </div>
