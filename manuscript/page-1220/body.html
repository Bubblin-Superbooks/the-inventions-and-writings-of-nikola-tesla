<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In experimenting with currents of high frequency and high potential, Mr. Tesla has found that insulating materials such as glass, mica, and in general those bodies which possess the highest specific inductive capacity, are inferior as insulators in such devices when currents of the kind described are employed compared with those possessing high insulating power, together with a smaller specific inductive capacity; and he has also found that it is very desirable to exclude all gaseous matter from the apparatus, or any access of the same to the electrified surfaces, in order to prevent heating by molecular bombardment and the loss or injury consequent thereon. He has therefore devised a method to accomplish these results and produce highly efficient and reliable condensers, by using oil as the dielectric</p></div> </div>
