<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This method consists in obtaining direct from alternating currents, or in directing the waves of an alternating current so as to produce direct or substantially direct currents by developing or producing in the branches of a circuit including a source of alternating currents, either permanently or periodically, and by electric, electro-magnetic, or magnetic agencies, manifestations of energy, or what may be termed active resistances of opposite electrical character, whereby the currents or current waves of opposite sign will be diverted through different circuits, those of one sign passing over one branch and those of opposite sign over the other.</p><p>We may consider herein only the case of a circuit divided into two paths, inasmuch as any further subdivision involves merely an extension of the general principle. Selecting, then, any circuit through which is flowing an alternating current, Mr. Tesla divides such circuit at any desired point into two branches or paths.</p></div> </div>
