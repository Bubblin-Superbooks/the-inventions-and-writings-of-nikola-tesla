<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But when the frequency is extremely high, and the arc of the discharge produces a very loud and smooth sound&mdash;showing both that oscillation takes place and that the sparks succeed each other with great rapidity&mdash;then the luminous streams formed are perfectly uniform. To reach this result very small coils and jars of small capacity should be used. I take two tubes of thick Bohemian glass, about 5 centimetres in diameter and 20 centimetres long. In each of the tubes I slip a primary of very thick copper wire. On the top of each tube I wind a secondary of much thinner gutta-percha covered wire. The two secondaries I connect in series, the primaries preferably in multiple arc. The tubes are then placed in a large glass vessel, at a distance of 10 to 15 centimetres from each other, on insulating supports, and the vessel is filled with boiled-out oil, the oil reaching about an inch above the tubes.</p></div> </div>
