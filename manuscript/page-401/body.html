<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> By a simple adjustment it is possible to produce with the coil a succession of brilliant sparks, exactly as with a Holtz machine.</p><p>Under certain conditions, when the frequency of the oscillation is very great, white, phantom-like streams are seen to break forth from the terminals of the coil. The chief interesting feature about them is, that they stream freely against the outstretched hand or other conducting object without producing any sensation, and the hand may be approached very near to the terminal without a spark being induced to jump. This is due presumably to the fact that a considerable portion of the energy is carried away or dissipated in the streamers, and the difference of potential between the terminal and the hand is diminished.</p></div> </div>
