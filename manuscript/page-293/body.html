<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This will be readily understood, for in a large synchronizing motor the length of the magnetic circuit of the polar projections, and their mass, are so great that apparently considerable time is required for magnetization and demagnetization. Hence with a current of a very high number of alternations the motor may not respond properly. To avoid this objection and to start up a synchronizing motor in which these conditions obtain, Mr. Tesla has combined two motors, one a synchronizing motor, the other a multiple-circuit or torque motor, and by the latter he brings the first-named up to speed, and then either throws the whole current into the synchronizing motor or operates jointly both of the motors.</p><p>This invention involves several novel and useful features.</p></div> </div>
