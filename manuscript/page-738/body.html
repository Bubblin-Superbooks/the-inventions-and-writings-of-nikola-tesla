<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The wire w, passing through the large tube to the outside of the bulb, should be well insulated&mdash;with a glass tube, for instance&mdash;and the space between ought to be filled out with some excellent insulator. Among many insulating powders I have found that mica powder is the best to employ. If this precaution is not taken, the tube T, protruding into the bulb, will surely be cracked in consequence of the heating by the brushes which are apt to form in the upper part of the tube, near the exhausted globe, especially if the vacuum be excellent, and therefore the potential necessary to operate the lamp be very high.</p><p>Fig. 149.Fig. 150.</p></div> </div>
