<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Figs. 92 and 93.</p><p>Mr. Tesla uses a core, A, which is closed upon itself&mdash;that is to say, of an annular cylindrical or equivalent form&mdash;and as the efficiency of the apparatus is largely increased by the subdivision of this core, he makes it of thin strips, plates, or wires of soft iron electrically insulated as far as practicable. Upon this core are wound, say, four coils, B B B' B', used as primary coils, and for which long lengths of comparatively fine wire are employed. Over these coils are then wound shorter coils of coarser wire, C C C' C', to constitute the induced or secondary coils. The construction of this or any equivalent form of converter may be carried further, as above pointed out, by inclosing these coils with iron&mdash;as, for example, by winding over the coils layers of insulated iron wire.</p></div> </div>
