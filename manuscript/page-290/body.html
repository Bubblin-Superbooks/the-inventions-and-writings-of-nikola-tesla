It is evident that both means of increasing the difference of phase&mdash;namely, by the special winding as well as by the supplemental or external inductive and dead resistance&mdash;may be employed conjointly.</p><p>In the operation of this motor the current impulses in the primary coils induce currents in the secondary coils, and by the conjoint action of the two the points of greatest magnetic attraction are shifted or rotated.</p><p>In practice it is found desirable to wind the armature with closed coils in which currents are induced by the action thereon of the primaries.</p></div> </div>
