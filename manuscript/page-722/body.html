<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If the electrode is composed of bodies of different character, and if one of these is more easily disintegrated than the other, most of the electricity supplied is carried off from that body, which is then brought to a higher temperature than the others, and this the more, as upon an increase of the temperature the body is still more easily disintegrated.</p><p>It seems to me quite probable that a similar process takes place in the bulb even with a homogeneous electrode, and I think it to be the principal cause of the disintegration. There is bound to be some irregularity, even if the surface is highly polished, which, of course, is impossible with most of the refractory bodies employed as electrodes. Assume that a point of the electrode gets hotter; instantly most of the discharge passes through that point, and a minute patch it probably fused and evaporated.</p></div> </div>
