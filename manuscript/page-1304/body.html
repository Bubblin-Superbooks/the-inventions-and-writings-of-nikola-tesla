<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>to the resistance of the circuit b M' c' c B, the potentials of the points x and Y will be equal, and no current will flow over the auxiliary brush; but when the brush c occupies a different position the potentials of the points x and Y will be different, and a current will flow over the auxiliary brush to and from the commutator, according to the relative position of the brushes. If, for instance, the commutator-space between the brushes a and c, when the latter is at the neutral point, is diminished, a current will flow from the point Y over the shunt c to the brush b, thus strengthening the current in the part M', and partly neutralizing the current in part M; but if the space between the brushes a and c is increased, the current will flow over the auxiliary brush in an opposite direction, and the current in M will be strengthened, and in M', partly neutralized.</p></div> </div>
