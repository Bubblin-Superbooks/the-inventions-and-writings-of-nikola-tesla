Two of these segments, as D D', are of metal and are in electrical connection with the ends of the coils on the armature. The other two segments are of insulating material. The segments are held in place by a band, B, of insulating material. The disc is held in place by friction or by screws, g' g', Fig. 248, which secure the disc firmly to the sleeve A'.</p></div> </div>
