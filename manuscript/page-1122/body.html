Pins L are set in the sides of the ring J and the coils M are wound over the periphery of the armature-structure and around the pins. The coils M are connected together in series, and these terminals N carried through the hollow shaft H to contact-rings P P, from which the currents are taken off by brushes O.</p><p>Fig. 199.</p><p>In this way a machine with a very large number of poles may be constructed.</p></div> </div>
