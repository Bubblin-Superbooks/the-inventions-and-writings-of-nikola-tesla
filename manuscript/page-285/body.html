<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The insertion of this coil will also cause a lagging or retardation of the currents traversing and delivered by the generator behind the impressed electromotive force, such lag being the mean or resultant of the lag of the current through the primary alone and of the "unretarded current" in the entire working circuit. Next consider the conditions imposed by the association in inductive relation with the primary coil, of a secondary coil. The current generated in the secondary coil will react upon the primary current, modifying the retardation of the same, according to the amount of self-induction and resistance in the secondary circuit. If the secondary circuit has but little self-induction&mdash;as, for instance, when it contains incandescent lamps only&mdash;it will increase the actual difference of phase between its own and the primary current, first, by diminishing the lag between the primary current and the impressed electromotive force, and, second, by its own lag or retardation behind the impressed electromotive force.</p></div> </div>
