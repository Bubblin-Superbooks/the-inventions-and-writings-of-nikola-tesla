<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The same conditions will be found to exist if, instead of assuming the poles B or C as acting independently, we regard the ideal resultant of both acting together, which is the real condition. To remedy this, the motor field is constructed with secondary poles B' C', which are situated between the others. These pole-pieces are wound with coils D' E', the former in derivation to the coils D, the latter to coils E. The main or primary coils D and E are wound for a different self-induction from that of the coils D' and E', the relations being so fixed that if the currents in D and E differ, for example, by a quarter-phase, the currents in each secondary coil, as D' E', will differ from those in its appropriate primary D or E by, say, forty-five degrees, or one-eighth of a period.</p></div> </div>
