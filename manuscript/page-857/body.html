<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Another line of experiment, which has been assiduously followed, was to induce by electro-dynamic induction a current or luminous discharge in an exhausted tube or bulb. This matter has received such able treatment at the hands of Prof. J. J. Thomson, that I could add but little to what he has made known, even had I made it the special subject of this lecture. Still, since experiments in this line have gradually led me to the present views and results, a few words must be devoted here to this subject.</p><p>It has occurred, no doubt, to many that as a vacuum tube is made longer, the electromotive force per unit length of the tube, necessary to pass a luminous discharge through the latter, becomes continually smaller; therefore, if the exhausted tube be made long enough, even with low frequencies a luminous discharge could be induced in such a tube closed upon itself.</p></div> </div>
