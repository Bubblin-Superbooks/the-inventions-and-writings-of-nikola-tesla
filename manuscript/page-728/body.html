<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The effectiveness of the metal tube as an electrostatic screen depends largely on the degree of exhaustion.</p><p>At excessively high degrees of exhaustion&mdash;which are reached by using great care and special means in connection with the Sprengel pump&mdash;when the matter in the globe is in the ultra-radiant state, it acts most perfectly. The shadow of the upper edge of the tube is then sharply defined upon the bulb.</p><p>At a somewhat lower degree of exhaustion, which is about the ordinary "non-striking" vacuum, and generally as long as the matter moves predominantly in straight lines, the screen still does well. In elucidation of the preceding remark it is necessary to state that what is a "non-striking" vacuum for a coil operated as ordinarily, by impulses, or currents, of low frequency, is not so, by far, when the coil is operated by currents of very high frequency.</p></div> </div>
