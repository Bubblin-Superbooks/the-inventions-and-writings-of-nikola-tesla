For instance, when an oxide was first fused in an oxygen blast, and then mounted in the bulb, it melted very readily into a drop.</p><p>Generally, during the process of fusion, magnificent light effects were noted, of which it would be difficult to give an adequate idea. Fig. 152 is intended to illustrate the effect observed with a ruby drop. At first one may see a narrow funnel of white light projected against the top of the globe, where it produces an irregularly outlined phosphorescent patch. When the point of the ruby fuses, the phosphorescence becomes very powerful; but as the atoms are projected with much greater speed from the surface of the drop, soon the glass gets hot and "tired," and now only the outer edge of the patch glows.</p></div> </div>
