<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The effective strength of the currents developed in the armature coils of the generator is dependent upon the strength of the currents energizing the generator and upon the number of rotations per unit of time of the magnetic poles of the generator; hence the speed of the motor armature will depend in all cases upon the relative speeds of the armature of the generator and of its magnetic poles. For example, if the poles are turned two thousand times per unit of time and the armature is turned eight hundred, the motor will turn twelve hundred times, or nearly so. Very slight differences of speed may be indicated by a delicately balanced motor.</p><p>Let it now be assumed that power is applied to the generator armature to turn it in a direction opposite to that in which its magnetic poles rotate.</p></div> </div>
