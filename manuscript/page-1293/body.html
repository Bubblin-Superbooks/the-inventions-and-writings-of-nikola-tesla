The commutator and the collector in thus presenting two flat and smooth bearing surfaces prevent most effectually by mechanical action the occurrence of sparks.</p><p>The insulating segments are made of some hard material capable of being polished and formed with sharp edges. Such materials as glass, marble, or soapstone may be advantageously used. The metal segments are preferably of copper or brass; but they may have a facing or edge of durable material&mdash;such as platinum or the like&mdash;where the sparks are liable to occur.</p></div> </div>
