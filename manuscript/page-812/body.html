<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 157.Fig. 158.</p><p>The globe L has in this case a large neck n, allowing the small bulb b to slip through. Otherwise the construction is the same as shown in Fig. 147, for example. The small bulb is conveniently supported upon the stem s, carrying the refractory button m. It is separated from the aluminum tube a by several layers of mica M, in order to prevent the cracking of the neck by the rapid heating of the aluminum tube upon a sudden turning on of the current. The inside bulb should be as small as possible when it is desired to obtain light only by incandescence of the electrode. If it is desired to produce phosphorescence, the bulb should be larger, else it would be apt to get too hot, and the phosphorescence would cease. In this arrangement usually only the small bulb shows phosphorescence, as there is practically no bombardment against the outer globe.</p></div> </div>
