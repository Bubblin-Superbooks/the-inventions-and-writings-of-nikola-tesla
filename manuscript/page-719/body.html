<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The bombardment goes at first against the upper surface of carbon, the lower parts being protected by the aluminum tube. As soon, however, as the non-conductor m is heated it is rendered good conducting, and then it becomes the centre of the bombardment, being most exposed to the same.</p><p>I have also constructed during these experiments many such single-wire bulbs with or without internal electrode, in which the radiant matter was projected against, or focused upon, the body to be rendered incandescent. Fig. 153 (page 263) illustrates one of the bulbs used. It consists of a spherical globe L, provided with a long neck n, on top, for increasing the action in some cases by the application of an external conducting coating. The globe L is blown out on the bottom into a very small bulb b, which serves to hold it firmly in a socket S of insulating material into which it is cemented.</p></div> </div>
