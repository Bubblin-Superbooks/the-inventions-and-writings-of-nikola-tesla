<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For example, the diagram shows a slotted plate, K, which is designed to be attached to a stationary support, and an arm extending from the collector and carrying a clamping screw, L, by which the collector may be adjusted and set to the desired position.</p><p>Mr. Tesla prefers the form shown in Figs. 246 and 247 to fit the insulating segments of both commutator and collector loosely and to provide some means&mdash;as, for example, light springs, e e, secured to the bands A' B', respectively, and bearing against the segments&mdash;to exert a light pressure upon them and keep them in close contact and to compensate for wear. The metal segments of the commutator may be moved forward by loosening the screw a'.</p></div> </div>
