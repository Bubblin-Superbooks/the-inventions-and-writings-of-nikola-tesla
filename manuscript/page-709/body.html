<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 148 illustrates such a bulb in a somewhat more advanced stage of perfection. A metallic tube S is fastened by means of some cement to the neck of the tube. In the tube is screwed a plug P, of insulating material, in the centre of which is fastened a metallic terminal t, for the connection to the leading-in wire w. This terminal must be well insulated from the metal tube S; therefore, if the cement used is conducting&mdash;and most generally it is sufficiently so&mdash;the space between the plug P and the neck of the bulb should be filled with some good insulating material, such as mica powder.</p><p>Fig. 149 shows a bulb made for experimental purposes. In this bulb the aluminum tube is provided with an external connection, which serves to investigate the effect of the tube under various conditions. It is referred to chiefly to suggest a line of experiment followed.</p></div> </div>
