The lamp is thus cut out as long as the carbons are separated. The cut out may be used in this form without any further improvement; but Mr. Tesla arranges it so that if the rod drops and the carbons come in contact the arc is started again. For this purpose he proportions the resistance of part p' and the number of the convolutions of the wire upon the main magnet so that when the carbons come in contact a sufficient amount of current is diverted through the carbons and the part x' to destroy or neutralize the magnetism of the compound magnet.</p></div> </div>
