Absorption always exists more or less, but generally it is small and of no consequence as long as the frequencies are not very great. In using extremely high frequencies, and, necessarily in such case, also high potentials, the absorption&mdash;or, what is here meant more particularly by this term, the loss of energy due to the presence of a gaseous medium&mdash;is an important factor to be considered, as the energy absorbed in the air condenser may be any fraction of the supplied energy.</p></div> </div>
