Or the result might have been produced by the change of phase of the primary and secondary currents and consequent reaction. But the chief determining factor is the relation of the self-induction and capacity of coil C and plate P1 and the frequency of the currents. The greater brightness of the filament in Fig. 179a, is, however, in part due to the heating of the rarefied gas in the lamp by electrostatic induction, which, as before remarked, is greater when the suspended plate is disconnected.</p></div> </div>
