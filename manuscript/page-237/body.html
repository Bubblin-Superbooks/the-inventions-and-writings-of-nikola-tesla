<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the second class the torque results from the energizing effects of a current upon different parts of the motor which differ in magnetic susceptibility&mdash;in other words, parts which respond in the same relative degree to the action of a current, not simultaneously, but after different intervals of time.</p><p>In another Tesla motor, however, the torque, instead of being solely the result of a time difference in the magnetic periods or phases of the poles or attractive parts to whatever cause due, is produced by an angular displacement of the parts which, though movable with respect to one another, are magnetized simultaneously, or approximately so, by the same currents. This principle of operation has been embodied practically in a motor in which the necessary angular displacement between the points of greatest magnetic attraction in the two elements of the motor&mdash;the armature and field&mdash;is obtained by the direction of the lamination of the magnetic cores of the elements.</p></div> </div>
