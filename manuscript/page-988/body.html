When I set the induction coil in operation the lamp filament is brought to high incandescence. It is, however, not necessary to use the insulated plate, for the lamp (l, Fig. 177) is rendered incandescent even if the plate P1 be disconnected. The secondary may also be connected to the primary as indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 177, to do away more or less with the electrostatic induction or to modify the action otherwise.</p></div> </div>
