In this way a comparatively small number of convolutions is sufficient to produce the required magnetism, while a greater surface is offered for cooling off the wires.</p><p>Fig. 286.Fig. 283.</p><p>Fig. 285.</p><p>Fig. 287.Fig. 288.</p><p>Fig. 284.</p><p>The upper pole pieces, m n, of the magnets are curved, as indicated in the drawings, Fig. 283. The lower pole pieces m' n', are brought near together, tapering toward the armature g, as shown in Figs. 284 and 286. The object of this taper is to concentrate the greatest amount of the developed magnetism upon the armature, and also to allow the pull to be exerted always upon the middle of the armature g.</p></div> </div>
