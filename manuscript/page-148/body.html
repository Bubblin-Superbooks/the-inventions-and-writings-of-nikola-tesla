<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The regulator may be constructed in many ways to secure the desired result; but that which is, perhaps, its best form is shown in Figs. 34 and 35.</p><p>A represents a frame of iron. B B are the cores of the inducing or primary coils C C. D is a shaft mounted on the side bars, D', and on which is secured a sectional iron core, E, wound with an induced or secondary coil, F, the convolutions of which are parallel with the axis of the shaft. The ends of the core are rounded off so as to fit closely in the space between the two poles and permit the core E to be turned to and held at any desired point. A handle, G, secured to the projecting end of the shaft D, is provided for this purpose.</p></div> </div>
