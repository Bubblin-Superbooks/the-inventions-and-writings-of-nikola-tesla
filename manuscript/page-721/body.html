<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In many experiments in which bodies of different kind were mounted in the bulb as, for instance, indicated in Fig. 152, some observations of interest were made.</p><p>It was found, among other things, that in such cases, no matter where the bombardment began, just as soon as a high temperature was reached there was generally one of the bodies which seemed to take most of the bombardment upon itself, the other, or others, being thereby relieved. The quality appeared to depend principally on the point of fusion, and on the facility with which the body was "evaporated," or, generally speaking, disintegrated&mdash;meaning by the latter term not only the throwing off of atoms, but likewise of large lumps. The observation made was in accordance with generally accepted notions. In a highly exhausted bulb, electricity is carried off from the electrode by independent carriers, which are partly the atoms, or molecules, of the residual atmosphere, and partly the atoms, molecules, or lumps thrown off from the electrode.</p></div> </div>
