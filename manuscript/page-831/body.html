Still, since experiments in this line have gradually led me to the present views and results, a few words must be devoted here to this subject.</p><p>It has occurred, no doubt, to many that as a vacuum tube is made longer, the electromotive force per unit length of the tube, necessary to pass a luminous discharge through the latter, becomes continually smaller; therefore, if the exhausted tube be made long enough, even with low frequencies a luminous discharge could be induced in such a tube closed upon itself. Such a tube might be placed around a hall or on a ceiling, and at once a simple appliance capable of giving considerable light would be obtained.</p></div> </div>
