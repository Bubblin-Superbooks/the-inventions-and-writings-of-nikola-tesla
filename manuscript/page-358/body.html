<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The truth of these views of Mr. Tesla is made evident by the interesting experiments illustrative of the behavior of the air between charged surfaces, the luminous streams formed by the charged molecules appearing even when great thicknesses of the best insulators are interposed between the charged surfaces. These luminous streams afford in themselves a very interesting study for the experimenter. With these rapidly alternating currents they become far more powerful and produce beautiful light effects when they issue from a wire, pinwheel or other object attached to a terminal of the coil; and it is interesting to note that they issue from a ball almost as freely as from a point, when the frequency is very high.</p><p>From these experiments we also obtain a better idea of the importance of taking into account the capacity and self-induction in the apparatus employed and the possibilities offered by the use of condensers in conjunction with</p></div> </div>
