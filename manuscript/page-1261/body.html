The first results in a reduction which amounts practically to a suppression of the spark, since the break and the short circuit produce opposite effects in the armature-coil. The second has the effect of diminishing the destructive effect of a spark, since this would be in a measure proportional to the duration of the spark; while lessening the duration of the short circuit obviously increases the efficiency of the machine.</p><p>Fig. 247.</p><p>The mechanical advantages will be better understood by referring to the accompanying diagrams, in which Fig. 246 is a central longitudinal section of the end of a shaft with the improved commutator carried thereon. Fig. 247 is a view of the inner or bearing face of the collector. Fig. 248 is an end view from the armature side of a modified form of commutator. Figs.</p></div> </div>
