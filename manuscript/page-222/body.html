<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mr. Tesla has therefore devised a motor embodying conditions that approach more nearly the theoretical requirements of perfect working, or in other words, he produces artificially a difference of magnetic phase by means of a current from a single primary source sufficient in extent to meet the requirements of practical and economical working. He employs a motor with two sets of energizing or field magnets, each wound with coils connected with a source of alternating or rapidly-varying currents, but forming two separate paths or circuits. The magnets of one set are protected to a certain extent from the energizing action of the current by means of a magnetic shield or screen interposed between the magnet and its energizing coil. This shield is properly adapted to the conditions of particular cases, so as to shield or protect the main core from magnetization until it has become itself saturated and no longer capable of containing all the lines of force produced by the current.</p></div> </div>
