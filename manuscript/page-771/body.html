<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the eye of the observer a single impact of the atoms would cause an instantaneous flash, but if the impacts were repeated with sufficient rapidity, they would produce a continuous impression upon his retina. To him then the surface of the metal would appear continuously incandescent and of constant luminous intensity, while in reality the light would be either intermittent, or at least changing periodically in intensity. The metal piece would rise in temperature until equilibrium was attained&mdash;that is, until the energy continuously radiated would equal that intermittently supplied. But the supplied energy might under such conditions not be sufficient to bring the body to any more than a very moderate mean temperature, especially if the frequency of the atomic impacts be very low&mdash;just enough that the fluctuation of the intensity of the light emitted could not be detected by the eye.</p></div> </div>
