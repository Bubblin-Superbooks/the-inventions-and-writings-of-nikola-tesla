This is far from being so, but, fortunately, the losses may be reduced to anything desired. A few remarks are necessary on this subject, in order to make the experiences gathered in the course of these investigations perfectly clear.</p><p>Suppose a small helix with many well insulated turns, as in experiment Fig. 146, has one of its ends connected to one of the terminals of the induction coil, and the other to a metal plate, or, for the sake of simplicity, a sphere, insulated in space. When the coil is set to work, the potential of the sphere is alternated, and a small helix now behaves as though its free end were connected to the other terminal of the induction coil.</p></div> </div>
