<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The part which takes the place of the usual brushes, or the "collector," is a disc of the same character as the commutator and has a surface similarly formed with two insulating and two metallic segments. These two parts are mounted with their faces in contact and in such manner that the rotation of the armature causes the commutator to turn upon the collector, whereby the currents induced in the coils are taken off by the collector segments and thence conveyed off by suitable conductors leading from the collector segments. This is the general plan of the construction adopted. Aside from certain adjuncts, the nature and functions of which are set forth later, this means of commutation will be seen to possess many important advantages. In the first place the short-circuiting and the breaking of the armature coil connected to the commutator-segments occur at the same instant, and from the nature of the construction this will be done with the greatest precision;</p></div> </div>
