<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Is it to be an incandescent solid, as in the present lamp, or an incandescent gas, or a phosphorescent body, or something like a burner, but incomparably more efficient?</p><p>There is little chance to perfect a gas burner; not, perhaps, because human ingenuity has been bent upon that problem for centuries without a radical departure having been made&mdash;though the argument is not devoid of force&mdash;but because in a burner the highest vibrations can never be reached, except by passing through all the low ones. For how is a flame to proceed unless by a fall of lifted weights? Such process cannot be maintained without renewal, and renewal is repeated passing from low to high vibrations. One way only seems to be open to improve a burner, and that is by trying to reach higher degrees of incandescence.</p></div> </div>
