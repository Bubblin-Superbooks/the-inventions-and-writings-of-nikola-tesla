<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A short time ago I had the honor to bring before our American Institute of Electrical Engineers some results then arrived at by me in a novel line of work. I need not assure you that the many evidences which I have received that English scientific men and engineers were interested in this work have been for me a great reward and encouragement. I will not dwell upon the experiments already described, except with the view of completing, or more clearly expressing, some ideas advanced by me before, and also with the view of rendering the study here presented self-contained, and my remarks on the subject of this evening's lecture consistent.</p><p>This investigation, then, it goes without saying, deals with alternating currents, and to be more precise, with alternating currents of high potential and high frequency.</p></div> </div>
