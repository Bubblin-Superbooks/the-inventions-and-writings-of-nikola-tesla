In such a case, if the typical form of motor illustrated in Fig. 9 is employed, one complete wave in each circuit will produce one revolution of the motor. In Fig. 19 the same result will be effected by one wave in each circuit, the impulses being successive; in Fig. 20 by four, and in Fig. 21 by eight waves.</p><p>By such means any desired speed may be attained, that is, at least within the limits of practical demands. This system possesses this advantage, besides others, resulting from simplicity. At full loads the motors show an efficiency fully equal to that of the continuous current motors. The transformers present an additional advantage in their capability of operating motors. They are capable of similar modifications in construction, and will facilitate the introduction of motors and their adaptation to practical demands. Their efficiency should be higher than that of the present transformers, and I base my assertion on the following:</p></div> </div>
