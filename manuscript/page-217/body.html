<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The cylindrical or drum armature D is of the same construction as in the other motors described, and is mounted to rotate within the annular frame J and between the U-shaped ends or bends of the coils F. The coils F are connected in multiple or in series with a source of alternating currents, and are so wound that with a current or current impulse of given direction they will make the alternate pole-pieces C of one polarity and the other pole-pieces C' of the opposite polarity. The principle of the operation of this motor is the same as the other above described, for, considering any two pole-pieces C C', a current impulse passing in the coil which bridges them or is wound over both tends to establish polarities in their ends of opposite sign and to set up in the armature core between them a polarity of the same sign as that of the nearest pole-piece C.</p></div> </div>
