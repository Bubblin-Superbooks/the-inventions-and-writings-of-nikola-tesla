<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the preceding descriptions relative to synchronizing motors and methods of operating them, reference has been made to the plan adopted by Mr. Tesla, which consists broadly in winding or arranging the motor in such manner that by means of suitable switches it could be started as a multiple-circuit motor, or one operating by a progression of its magnetic poles, and then, when up to speed, or nearly so, converted into an ordinary synchronizing motor, or one in which the magnetic poles were simply alternated. In some cases, as when a large motor is used and when the number of alternations is very high, there is more or less difficulty in bringing the motor to speed as a double or multiple-circuit motor, for the plan of construction which renders the motor best adapted to run as a synchronizing motor impairs its efficiency as a torque or double-circuit motor under the assumed conditions on the start.</p></div> </div>
