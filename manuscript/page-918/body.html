<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The three branches of the circuit A represent the usual cases met in practice when alternating currents are converted. In Fig. 1b a condenser C, generally of large capacity, is connected to the circuit L containing the devices l l, m m. The devices m m are supposed to be of high self-induction so as to bring the frequency of the circuit more or less to that of the dynamo. In this instance the discharger d d should best have a number of makes and breaks per second equal to twice the frequency of the dynamo. If not so, then it should have at least a number equal to a multiple or even fraction of the dynamo frequency. It should be observed, referring to Ib, that the conversion to a high potential is also effected when the discharger d d, which is shown in the sketch, is omitted.</p></div> </div>
