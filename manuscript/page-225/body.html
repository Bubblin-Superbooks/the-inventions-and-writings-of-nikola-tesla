<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The armature-winding may be similar to that of the field&mdash;that is to say, the armature may have two or more coils wound or adapted for different self-induction and adapted, preferably, to produce the same difference of phase as the field-coils. On starting the motor the shunt is closed around both coils. This is shown in Fig. 51, in which the armature coils are F G. To indicate their different electrical character, there are shown in circuit with them, respectively, the resistance R' and the self-induction coil S'. The two armature coils are in series with the field-coils and the same disposition of the shunt or short-circuit D is used. It is of advantage in the operation of motors of this kind to construct or wind the armature in such manner that when short-circuited on the start it will have a tendency to reach a higher speed than that which synchronizes with the generator.</p></div> </div>
