Upon the passage of the current the main magnet is energized and attracts the clamping-armature g, swinging the clamp and gripping the rod by means of the gripping jaws e e. At the same time the armature lever L is pulled down and the carbons are separated. In pulling down the armature lever L the main magnet is assisted by the shunt-magnet N, the latter being magnetized by magnetic induction from the magnet M.</p></div> </div>
