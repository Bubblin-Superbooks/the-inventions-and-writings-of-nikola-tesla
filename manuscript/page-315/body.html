Fig. 87 is a central section, in line with the shaft, of a special form of armature core. Fig. 88 is a similar section of a modification of the same. Fig. 89 is one of the sections of the core detached. Fig. 90 is a diagram showing a modified disposition of the armature or induced circuits.</p><p>The general plan of the invention is illustrated in Fig. 86. A A in this figure represent the the frame and field magnets of an alternating current motor, the poles or projections of which are wound with coils B and C, forming independent energizing circuits connected either to the same or to independent sources of alternating currents, so that the currents flowing through the circuits, respectively, will have a difference of phase.</p></div> </div>
