<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In a preceding chapter we have described a method by which Mr. Tesla accomplishes the change in his type of rotating field motor from a torque to a synchronizing motor. As will be observed, the desired end is there reached by a change in the circuit connections at the proper moment. We will now proceed to describe another way of bringing about the same result. The principle involved in this method is as follows:&mdash;</p><p>If an alternating current be passed through the field coils only of a motor having two energizing circuits of different self-induction and the armature coils be short-circuited, the motor will have a strong torque, but little or no tendency to synchronism with the generator; but if the same current which energizes the field be passed also through the armature coils the tendency to remain in synchronism is very considerably increased.</p></div> </div>
