<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Here is an exhausted bulb suspended from a single wire. Standing on an insulated support, I grasp it, and a platinum button mounted in it is brought to vivid incandescence.</p><p>Here, attached to a leading wire, is another bulb, which, as I touch its metallic socket, is filled with magnificent colors of phosphorescent light.</p><p>Here still another, which by my fingers' touch casts a shadow&mdash;the Crookes shadow&mdash;of the stem inside of it.</p><p>Here, again, insulated as I stand on this platform, I bring my body in contact with one of the terminals of the secondary of this induction coil&mdash;with the end of a wire many miles long&mdash;and you see streams of light break forth from its distant end, which is set in violent vibration.</p></div> </div>
