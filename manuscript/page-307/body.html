Mr. Tesla early began to apply the condenser to alternating apparatus, in just how many ways can only be learned from a perusal of other portions of this volume, especially those dealing with his high frequency work.</p><p>Certain laws govern the action or effects produced by a condenser when connected to an electric circuit through which an alternating or in general an undulating current is made to pass. Some of the most important of such effects are as follows: First, if the terminals or plates of a condenser be connected with two points of a circuit, the potentials of which are made to rise and fall in rapid succession, the condenser allows the passage, or more strictly speaking, the transference of</p></div> </div>
