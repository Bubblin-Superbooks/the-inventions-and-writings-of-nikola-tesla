<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The general opinion, I do not doubt, is that it is out of the question to reach any such frequencies as might&mdash;assuming some of the views before expressed to be true&mdash;produce any of the results which I have pointed out as mere possibilities. This may be so, but in the course of these investigations, from the observation of many phenomena, I have gained the conviction that these frequencies would be much lower than one is apt to estimate at first. In a flame we set up light vibrations by causing molecules, or atoms, to collide. But what is the ratio of the frequency of the collisions and that of the vibrations set up? Certainly it must be incomparably smaller than that of the strokes of the bell and the sound vibrations, or that of the discharges and the oscillations of the condenser.</p></div> </div>
