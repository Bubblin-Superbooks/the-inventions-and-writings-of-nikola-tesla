<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Another difficulty&mdash;which, however, is always present when the refractory button is mounted in a very small bulb&mdash;existed in the construction illustrated in Fig. 158, namely, the vacuum in the bulb b would be impaired in a comparatively short time.</p><p>The chief idea in the two last described constructions was to confine the heat to the central portion of the globe by preventing the exchange of air. An advantage is secured, but owing to the heating of the inside bulb and slow evaporation of the glass, the vacuum is hard to maintain, even if the construction illustrated in Fig. 157 be chosen, in which both bulbs communicate.</p><p>But by far the better way&mdash;the ideal way&mdash;would be to reach sufficiently high frequencies. The higher the frequency, the slower would be the exchange of the air, and I think that a frequency may be reached, at which there would be no exchange whatever of the air molecules around the terminal.</p></div> </div>
