<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 25 is a diagram illustrative of the mode of applying the invention to the well-known type of "closed" or continuous circuit machines. Fig. 26 is a similar diagram embodying an armature with separate coils connected diametrically, or what is generally called an "open-circuit" machine. Fig. 27 is a diagram showing the application of the invention to a machine the armature-coils of which have a common joint.</p><p>Fig. 25.</p><p>Referring to Fig. 25, let A represent a Tesla motor or transformer which, for convenience, we will designate as a "converter." It consists of an annular core, B, wound with four independent coils, C and D, those diametrically opposite being connected together so as to co-operate in pairs in establishing free poles in the ring, the tendency of each pair being to fix the poles at ninety degrees from the other.</p></div> </div>
