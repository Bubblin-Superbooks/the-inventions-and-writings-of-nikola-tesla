This type of machine is represented in Fig. 26. In this machine each pair of coils goes through the same phases as the coils in some of the generators already shown, and it is obviously only necessary to utilize them in pairs or sets to operate a Tesla converter by extending the segments of the commutators belonging to each pair of coils and causing a collecting brush to bear on the continuous portion of each segment.</p></div> </div>
