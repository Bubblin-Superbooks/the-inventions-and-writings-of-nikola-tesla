His invention consists in placing a condenser in the secondary or induced circuit of the motor above described and raising the potential of the secondary currents to such a degree that the capacity of the condenser, which is in part dependent on the potential, need be quite small. The value of this condenser is determined in a well-understood manner with reference to the self-induction and other conditions of the circuit, so as to cause the currents which pass through it to differ from the primary currents by a quarter phase.</p></div> </div>
