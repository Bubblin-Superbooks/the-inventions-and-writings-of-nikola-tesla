<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The opposite ends of these two circuits are connected to the contact m of a switch, the handle or lever of which is in connection with the line-wire L'. One end of the field circuit of the synchronizing motor is connected to the wire L. The other terminates in the switch-contact n. From the diagram it will be readily seen that if the lever P be turned upon contact m, the torque motor will start by reason of the difference of phase between the currents in its two energizing circuits. Then when the desired speed is attained, if the lever P be shifted upon contact n the entire current will pass through the field coils of the synchronizing motor and the other will be doing no work.</p><p>The torque motor may be constructed and operated in various ways, many of which have already been touched upon.</p></div> </div>
