<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Thus the self-induction of the secondary is kept down and its resistance increased, with the result of decreasing the lag between the impressed electro-motive force and the current in the primary coils and increasing the difference of phase between the primary and secondary currents.</p><p>In the disposition shown in Fig. 76, the lag in the secondary is increased by increasing the self-induction of that circuit, while the increasing tendency of the primary to lag is counteracted by inserting therein a dead resistance. The primary coils D in this case have a low self-induction and high resistance, while the coils E F, included in the secondary circuit, have a high self-induction and low resistance. This may be done by the proper winding of the coils; or in the circuit including the secondary coils E F, we may introduce a self-induction coil S, while in the primary circuit from the generator G and including coils D, there may be inserted a dead resistance R.</p></div> </div>
