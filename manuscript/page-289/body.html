These modifications are illustrated further on.</p><p>Fig. 70.Fig. 71.</p><p>Fig. 69 is a diagrammatic illustration of a motor and system in which the difference of phase is artificially produced. There are two coils D D in one branch and two coils E E in another branch of the main circuit from the generator G. These two circuits or branches are of different self-induction, one, as D, being higher than the other. This is graphically indicated by making coils D much larger than coils E. By reason of the difference in the electrical character of the two circuits, the phases of current in one are retarded to a greater extent than the other. Let this difference be thirty degrees.</p></div> </div>
