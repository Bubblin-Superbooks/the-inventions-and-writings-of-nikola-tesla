Fig. 28 is a diagrammatic illustration of a generator constructed in accordance with the invention. Fig. 29 is a similar view of a correspondingly constructed motor. Fig. 30 is a diagram of a generator of modified construction. Fig. 31 is a diagram of a motor of corresponding character. Fig. 32 is a diagram of a system containing a generator and several motors adapted to run at various speeds.</p></div> </div>
