<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The resistance of one conductor is by this means diminished, while that of the other is increased, both in proportion to the strength of the current passing through the conductors. From such variation in the resistance of either or both of the conductors forming the positive and negative electrodes of the cell, the current energy expended may be readily computed. Figs. 229 and 230 illustrate two forms of such a meter.</p><p>Fig. 229.</p><p>In Fig. 229 G designates a direct-current generator. L L are the conductors of the circuit extending therefrom. A is a tube of glass, the ends of which are sealed, as by means of insulating plugs or caps B B. C C' are two conductors extending through the tube A, their ends passing out through the plugs B to terminals thereon. These conductors may be corrugated or formed in other proper ways to offer the desired electrical resistance.</p></div> </div>
