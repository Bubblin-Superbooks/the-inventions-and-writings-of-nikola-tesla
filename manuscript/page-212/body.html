<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Such a motor has a good torque at starting; yet it has also considerable tendency to synchronism, owing to the fact that when properly constructed the maximum magnetic effects in both armature and field coincide&mdash;a condition which in the usual construction of these motors with closed armature coils is not readily attained. The motor thus constructed exhibits too, a better regulation of current from no load to load, and there is less difference between the apparent and real energy expended in running it. The true synchronous speed of this form of motor is that of the generator when both are alike&mdash;that is to say, if the number of the coils on the armature and on the field is x, the motor will run normally at the same speed as a generator driving it if the number of field magnets or poles of the same be also x.</p></div> </div>
