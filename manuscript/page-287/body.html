The better results are obtained when the primary has a low self-induction.</p><p>Fig. 75.Fig. 76.</p><p>Fig. 75 is a diagram of a Tesla motor embodying this principle. Fig. 76 is a similar diagram of a modification of the same. In Fig. 75 let A designate the field-magnet of a motor which, as in all these motors, is built up of sections or plates. B C are polar projections upon which the coils are wound. Upon one pair of these poles, as C, are wound primary coils D, which are directly connected to the circuit of an alternating current generator G.</p></div> </div>
