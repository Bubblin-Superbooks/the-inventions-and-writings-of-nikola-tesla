<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Instead of bringing the primary and secondary coils or circuits of a transformer into the closest possible relations, as has hitherto been done, Mr. Tesla protects in a measure the secondary from the inductive action or effect of the primary by surrounding either the primary or the secondary with a comparatively thin magnetic shield or screen. Under these modified conditions, as long as the primary current has a small value, the shield protects the secondary; but as soon as the primary current has reached a certain strength, which is arbitrarily determined, the protecting magnetic shield becomes saturated and the inductive action upon the secondary begins. It results, therefore, that the secondary current begins to flow at a certain fraction of a period later than it would without the interposed shield, and since this retardation may be obtained without necessarily retarding the primary current also, an additional lag is secured, and the time interval between the maximum or minimum periods of the primary and secondary currents is increased.</p></div> </div>
