<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It will be observed that in such a disposition as is illustrated in Fig. 49, the field circuits A and B being of different self-induction, there will always be a greater lag of the current in one than the other, and that, generally, the armature phases will not correspond with either, but with the resultant of both. It is therefore important to observe the proper rule in winding the armature. For instance, if the motor have eight poles&mdash;four in each circuit&mdash;there will be four resultant poles, and hence the armature winding should be such as to produce four poles, in order to constitute a true synchronizing motor.</p><p>Fig. 52.</p><p>The diagram, Fig. 50, differs from the previous one only in respect to the order of connections. In the present case the armature-coil, instead of being in series with the field-coils, is in multiple arc therewith.</p></div> </div>
