In such a case, as far as the body itself is concerned, only frictional losses in the inside could occur.</p><p>It is a striking fact that the discharge through a gas is established with ever-increasing freedom as the frequency of the impulses is augmented. It behaves in this respect quite contrarily to a metallic conductor. In the latter the impedance enters prominently into play as the frequency is increased, but the gas acts much as a series of condensers would; the facility with which the discharge passes through, seems to depend on the rate of change of potential.</p></div> </div>
