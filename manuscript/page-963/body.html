<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In this experiment the force acting between the plates changes in intensity and direction at a very rapid rate. I will now make the rate of change per unit time much smaller. This I effect by rendering the discharges through the primary of the induction coil less frequent, and also by diminishing the rapidity of the vibration in the secondary. The former result is conveniently secured by lowering the e. m. f. over the air gap in the primary circuit, the latter by approaching the two brass plates to a distance of about three or four inches. When the coil is set to work, you see no streamers or light between the plates, yet the medium between them is under a tremendous strain. I still further augment the strain by raising the e. m. f. in the primary circuit, and soon you see the air give way and the hall is illuminated by a shower of brilliant and noisy sparks, Fig. 170b.</p></div> </div>
