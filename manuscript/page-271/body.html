<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In applying these coils to a motor, Mr. Tesla builds up a field-magnet of plates C, of iron and steel, secured together in the usual manner by bolts D. Each plate is formed with four (more or less) long cores E, around which is a space to receive the coil and an equal number of short projections F to receive the coils of the resistance-circuit. The plates are generally annular in shape, having an open space in the centre for receiving the armature G, which Mr. Tesla prefers to wind with closed coils. An alternating current divided between the two circuits is retarded as to its phases in the circuit A to a much greater extent than in the circuit B. By reason of the relative sizes and disposition of the cores and coils the magnetic effect of the poles E and F upon the armature closely approximate.</p></div> </div>
