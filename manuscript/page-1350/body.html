<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The first group of coils of the first part of wire being wound and connected to the commutator-bars in the usual manner, this group is insulated and the second group wound; but the coils of this second group, instead of being connected to the next following commutator bars, are connected to the directly opposite bars of the commutator. The second group is then insulated and the third group wound, the coils of this group being connected to those bars to which they would be connected in the usual way. The wires are then thoroughly insulated and the second part of wire is wound and connected in the same manner.</p><p>Suppose, for instance, that there are twenty-four coils&mdash;that is, twelve in each part&mdash;and consequently twenty-four commutator plates. There will be in each part three groups, each containing four coils, and the coils will be connected as follows:</p></div> </div>
