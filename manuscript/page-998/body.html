<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The plate may now be connected to one of the coatings of the second jar, and when it is brought near to the first jar just previously charged to a high potential from an influence machine, the result is the same as before, and the first jar will discharge through a small air space upon the second being caused to discharge. But both jars and their circuits need not be tuned any closer than a basso profundo is to the note produced by a mosquito, as small sparks will be produced through the air space, or at least the latter will be considerably more strained owing to the setting up of an alternating e. m. f. by induction, which takes place when one of the jars begins to discharge. Again another error of a similar nature is quite easily made.</p></div> </div>
