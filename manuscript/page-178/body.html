The inductive effect is therefore impaired, and the current delivered by coil F will continue to diminish in proportion to the angle at which the coil F is turned until, after passing through an angle of ninety degrees, the convolutions of the coil will be at right angles to those of coils C C, and the inductive effect reduced to a minimum.</p><p>Incidentally to certain constructions, other causes may influence the variation in the strength of the induced currents. For example, in the present case it will be observed that by the first movement of coil F a certain portion of its convolutions are carried beyond the line of the direct influence of the lines of force, and that the magnetic path or circuit for the lines is impaired; hence the inductive effect would be reduced.</p></div> </div>
