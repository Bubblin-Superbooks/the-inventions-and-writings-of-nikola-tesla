<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>No electrical inventor of the present day dealing with the problems of light and power considers that he has done himself or his opportunities justice until he has attacked the subject of thermo-magnetism. As far back as the beginning of the seventeenth century it was shown by Dr. William Gilbert, the father of modern electricity, that a loadstone or iron bar when heated to redness loses its magnetism; and since that time the influence of heat on the magnetic metals has been investigated frequently, though not with any material or practical result.</p><p>For a man of Mr. Tesla's inventive ability, the problems in this field have naturally had no small fascination, and though he has but glanced at them, it is to be hoped he may find time to pursue the study deeper and further. For such as he, the investigation must undoubtedly bear fruit. Meanwhile he has worked out one or two operative devices worthy of note.</p></div> </div>
