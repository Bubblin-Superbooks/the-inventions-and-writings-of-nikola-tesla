<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When the metal disc is covered with carborundum crystals, the film is far more intense, and snow-white. This I found later to be merely an effect of the bright surface of the crystals, for when an aluminum electrode was highly polished, it exhibited more or less the same phenomenon. I made a number of experiments with the samples of crystals obtained, principally because it would have been of special interest to find that they are capable of phosphorescence, on account of their being conducting. I could not produce phosphorescence distinctly, but I must remark that a decisive opinion cannot be formed until other experimenters have gone over the same ground.</p><p>The powder behaved in some experiments as though it contained alumina, but it did not exhibit with sufficient distinctness the red of the latter.</p></div> </div>
