This may be accomplished in various ways; but for all practical purposes the following will suffice: On the armature are wound two sets of coils. At the start only one of these is short-circuited, thereby producing a number of poles on the armature, which will tend to run the speed up above the synchronous limit. When such limit is reached or passed, the current is directed through the other coil, which, by increasing the number of armature poles, tends to maintain synchronism.</p><p>Fig. 53.</p><p>In Fig. 52, such a disposition is shown. The motor having, say, eight poles contains two field-circuits A and B, of different self-induction. The armature has two coils F and G. The former is closed upon itself, the latter connected with the field and line through contact-rings a b, brushes c d, and a switch E.</p></div> </div>
