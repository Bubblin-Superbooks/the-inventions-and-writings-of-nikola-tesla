<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It is not necessary that one motor be cut out of circuit while the other is in, for both may be acted upon by current at the same time, and Mr. Tesla has devised various dispositions or arrangements of the two motors for accomplishing this. Some of these arrangements are illustrated in Figs. 81 to 85.</p><p>Fig. 80.</p><p>Referring to Fig. 81, let T designate the torque or multiple circuit motor and S the synchronizing motor, L L' being the line-wires from a source of alternating current. The two circuits of the torque motor of different degrees of self-induction, and designated by N M, are connected in derivation to the wire L. They are then joined and connected to the energizing circuit of the synchronizing motor, the opposite terminal of which is connected to wire L'. The two motors are thus in series.</p></div> </div>
