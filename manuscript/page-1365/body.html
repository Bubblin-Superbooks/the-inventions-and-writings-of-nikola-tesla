The lower ends of the cores M' N2 are made with laterally projecting pole-pieces M3 N3, respectively, and these pole-pieces are concave at their outer ends, and are at opposite sides of the armature segments r at the lower end of the tubular clamp R.</p><p>The operation of these devices is as follows: In the condition of inaction, the upper carbon rests upon the lower one, and when the electric current is turned on it passes freely, by the frame and spring l, through the rods and carbons to the coarse wire and helix M, and to the negative binding post V and the core M' thereby is energized. The pole piece M3 attracts the armature r, and by the lateral pressure causes the clamp R to grasp the rod S', and the lever A is simultaneously moved from the position shown by dotted lines, Fig.</p></div> </div>
