In both these classes of lamps it has been customary to use dash pot, clock work, or equivalent retarding devices; but these are often unreliable and objectionable, and increase the cost of construction.</p><p>Mr. Tesla combines two electro-magnets&mdash;one of low resistance in the main or lamp circuit, and the other of comparatively high resistance in a shunt around the arc&mdash;a movable armature lever, and a special feed mechanism, the parts being arranged so that in the normal working position of the armature lever the same is kept almost rigidly in one position, and is not affected even by considerable changes in the electric circuit;</p></div> </div>
