<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With the object of obtaining the desired speed in motors operated by means of alternating currents of differing phase, Mr. Tesla has devised various plans intended to meet the practical requirements of the case, in adapting his system to types of multipolar alternating current machines yielding a large number of current reversals for each revolution.</p><p>For example, Mr. Tesla has pointed out that to adapt a given type of alternating current generator, you may couple rigidly two complete machines, securing them together in such a way that the requisite difference in phase will be produced; or you may fasten two armatures to the same shaft within the influence of the same field and with the requisite angular displacement to yield the proper difference in phase between the two currents; or two armatures may be attached to the same shaft with their coils symmetrically disposed, but subject to the influence of two sets of field magnets duly displaced;</p></div> </div>
