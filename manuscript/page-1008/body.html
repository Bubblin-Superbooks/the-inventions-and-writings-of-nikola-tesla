I have not been able to produce, nor have I observed with currents from a dynamo machine, such great rises of potential. It is possible, if not probable, that with currents obtained from apparatus containing iron the disturbing influence of the latter is the cause that these theoretical possibilities cannot be realized. But if such is the case I attribute it solely to the hysteresis and Foucault current losses in the core. Generally it was necessary to transform upward, when the e. m. f. was very low, and usually an ordinary form of induction coil was employed, but sometimes the arrangement illustrated in Fig. 184 II., has been found to be convenient.</p></div> </div>
