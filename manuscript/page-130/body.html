<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To adapt such a machine to his system, Mr. Tesla adds a second set of induced conductors M, in all respects similar to the first, but so placed in reference to it that the currents produced in each will differ by a quarter-phase. With such relations it is evident that as the current decreases in conductor L it increases in conductor M, and conversely, and that any of the forms of Tesla motor invented for use in this system may be operated by such a generator.</p><p>Fig. 31 is intended to show a motor corresponding to the machine in Fig. 30. The construction of the motor is identical with that of the generator, and if coupled thereto it will run synchronously therewith. J' J' are the field-magnets, and K' the coils thereon. L' is one of the armature-conductors and M' the other.</p></div> </div>
