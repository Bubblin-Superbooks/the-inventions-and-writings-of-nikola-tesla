Phosphorescent bulbs may be excited in such a field, and it is easy to regulate the effect by connecting to the bulb a small insulated metal plate. It was likewise possible to maintain a filament or button mounted in a tube at bright incandescence, and, in one experiment, a mica vane was spun by the incandescence of a platinum wire.</p><p>Coming now to the lecture delivered in Philadelphia and St. Louis, it may be remarked that to the superficial reader, Mr. Tesla's introduction, dealing with the importance of the eye, might appear as a digression, but the thoughtful reader will find therein much food for meditation and speculation.</p></div> </div>
