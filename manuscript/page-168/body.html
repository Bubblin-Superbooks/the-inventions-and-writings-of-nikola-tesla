<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Near the motor is placed a switch the action of which is that of the one shown in the diagrams, which is constructed as follows: F F' are two conducting plates or arms, pivoted at their ends and connected by an insulating cross-bar, H, so as to be shifted in parallelism. In the path of the bars F F' is the contact 2, which forms one terminal of the circuit through coils C, and the contact 4, which is one terminal of the circuit through coils B. The opposite end of the wire of coils C is connected to the wire L or bar F', and the corresponding end of coils B is connected to wire L' and bar F; hence if the bars be shifted so as to bear on contacts 2 and 4 both sets of coils B C will be included in the circuit L L' in multiple arc or derivation. In the path of the levers F F' are two other contact terminals, 1 and 3.</p></div> </div>
