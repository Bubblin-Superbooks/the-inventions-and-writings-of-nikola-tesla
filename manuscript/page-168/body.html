<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This is due to two causes: first, to the great differences in the speeds of the motor and generator, and, secondly, to the fact that the apparatus follows the analogy of a transformer, for, in proportion as the resistance of the armature or secondary circuits is reduced, the strength of the currents in the field or primary circuits of the generator is increased and the currents in the armature are augmented correspondingly. For similar reasons the currents in the armature-coils of the generator increase very rapidly when the speed of the armature is reduced when running in the same direction as the magnetic poles or conversely.</p><p>It will be understood from the above description that the generator-armature may be run in the direction of the shifting of the magnetic poles, but more rapidly, and that in such case the speed of the motor will be equal to the difference between the two rates.</p></div> </div>
