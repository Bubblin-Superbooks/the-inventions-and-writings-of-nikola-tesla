<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In this form of motor, Mr. Tesla's object is to design and build machines wherein the maxima of the magnetic effects of the armature and field will more nearly coincide than in some of the types previously under consideration. These types are: First, motors having two or more energizing circuits of the same electrical character, and in the operation of which the currents used differ primarily in phase; second, motors with a plurality of energizing circuits of different electrical character, in or by means of which the difference of phase is produced artificially, and, third, motors with a plurality of energizing circuits, the currents in one being induced from currents in another. Considering the structural and operative conditions of any one of them&mdash;as, for example, that first named&mdash;</p></div> </div>
