The carbon cup, containing zirconia, had to be mounted very low in the neck of a large bulb, as the heating of the glass by the projected particles of the oxide was so rapid that in the first trial the bulb was cracked almost in an instant, when the current was turned on. The heating of the glass by the projected particles was found to be always greater when the carbon cup contained a body which was rapidly carried off&mdash;I presume, because in such cases, with the same potential, higher speeds were reached, and also because, per unit of time, more matter was projected&mdash;that is, more particles would strike the glass.</p></div> </div>
