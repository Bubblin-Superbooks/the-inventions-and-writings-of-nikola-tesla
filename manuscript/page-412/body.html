<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In operating an induction coil with these rapidly alternating currents, it is astonishing to note, for the first time, the great importance of the relation of capacity, self-induction, and frequency as bearing upon the general result. The combined effect of these elements produces many curious effects. For instance, two metal plates are connected to the terminals and set at a small distance, so that an arc is formed between them. This arc prevents a strong current from flowing through the coil. If the arc be interrupted by the interposition of a glass plate, the capacity of the condenser obtained counteracts the self-induction, and a stronger current is made to pass. The effects of capacity are the most striking, for in these experiments, since the self-induction and frequency both are high, the critical capacity is very small, and need be but slightly varied to produce a very considerable change.</p></div> </div>
