<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Curiously enough it appeared in some of the experiments made, that a body was fused in a bulb under the molecular impact by evolution of less light than when fused by the application of heat in ordinary ways. This may be ascribed to a loosening of the structure of the body under the violent impacts and changing stresses.</p><p>Some experiments seem to indicate that under certain conditions a body, conducting or nonconducting, may, when bombarded, emit light, which to all appearances is due to phosphorescence, but may in reality be caused by the incandescence of an infinitesimal layer, the mean temperature of the body being comparatively small. Such might be the case if each single rhythmical impact were capable of instantaneously exciting the retina, and the rhythm were just high enough to cause a continuous impression in the eye.</p></div> </div>
