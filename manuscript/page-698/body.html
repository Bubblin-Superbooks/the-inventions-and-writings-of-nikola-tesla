The static screen may, however, be omitted, and simply a thickness of insulating material fastened to one of the sides of the fan.</p><p>To show the behavior of the coil, the fan may be placed upon the terminal and it will readily rotate when the coil is operated by currents of very high frequency. With a steady potential, of course, and even with alternating currents of very low frequency, it would not turn, because of the very slow exchange of air and, consequently, smaller bombardment; but in the latter case it might turn if the potential were excessive.</p></div> </div>
