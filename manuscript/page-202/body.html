<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A description is given elsewhere of a method of operating alternating current motors by first rotating their magnetic poles until they have attained synchronous speed, and then alternating the poles. The motor is thus transformed, by a simple change of circuit connections from one operated by the action of two or more independent energizing currents to one operated either by a single current or by several currents acting as one. Another way of doing this will now be described.</p><p>At the start the magnetic poles of one element or field of the motor are progressively shifted by alternating currents differing in phase and passed through independent energizing circuits, and short circuit the coils of the other element. When the motor thus started reaches or passes the limit of speed synchronous with the generator, Mr. Tesla connects up the coils previously short-circuited with a source of direct current and by a change of the circuit connections produces a simple alternation of the poles.</p></div> </div>
