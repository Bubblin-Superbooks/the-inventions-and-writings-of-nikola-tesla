It should also be stated that the arc should not exceed a certain length.</p><p>Figs. 200, 201, 202 and 203.</p><p>The difficulties encountered in the construction of these machines are of a mechanical as well as an electrical nature. The machines may be designed on two plans: the field may be formed either of alternating poles, or of polar projections of the same polarity. Up to about 15,000 alternations per second in an experimental machine, the former plan may be followed, but a more efficient machine is obtained on the second plan.</p></div> </div>
