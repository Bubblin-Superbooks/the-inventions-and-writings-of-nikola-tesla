<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Figs. 42 to 47, inclusive, are diagrams of different ways in which the invention is carried out; and Fig. 48, a side view of a form of motor used by Mr. Tesla for this purpose.</p><p>Figs. 42, 43 and 44.</p><p>A B in Fig. 42 indicate the two energizing circuits of a motor, and C D two circuits on the armature. Circuit or coil A is connected in series with circuit or coil C, and the two circuits B D are similarly connected. Between coils A and C is a contact-ring e, forming one terminal of the latter, and a brush a, forming one terminal of the former. A ring d and brush c similarly connect coils B and D. The opposite terminals of the field-coils connect to one binding post h of the motor, and those of the armature coils are similarly connected to the opposite binding post i through a contact-ring f and brush g.</p></div> </div>
