<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 23.</p><p>So far as the apparent action or mode of operation of this arrangement is concerned, the single wire D, which is, so to speak, a common return-wire for both circuits, may be regarded as two independent wires. In the illustration, with the order of connection shown, coil B' of the generator is producing its maximum current and coil B its minimum; hence the current which passes through wire e, ring b, brush b', line-wire E, terminal E', wire j, coils I I, wire or terminal D', line-wire D, brush a', ring a, and wire f, fixes the polar line of the motor midway between the two coils I I; but as the coil B' moves from the position indicated it generates less current, while coil B, moving into the field, generates more.</p></div> </div>
