<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 257.</p><p>In a further method devised by Mr. Tesla, one or more auxiliary brushes are employed, by means of which a portion or the whole of the field coils is shunted. According to the relative position upon the commutator of the respective brushes more or less current is caused to pass through the helices of the field, and the current developed by the machine can be varied at will by varying the relative positions of the brushes.</p><p>In Fig. 259, a and b are the positive and negative brushes of the main circuit, and c an auxiliary brush. The main circuit D extends from the brushes a and b, as usual, and contains the helices M of the field wire and the electric lamps or other working devices. The auxiliary brush c is connected to the point x of the main circuit by means of the wire c'. H is a commutator of ordinary construction.</p></div> </div>
