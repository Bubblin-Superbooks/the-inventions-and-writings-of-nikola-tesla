The connections from the high tension winding are quite similar to those in branch Ia with the exception that a condenser C, which should be adjustable, is connected to the high tension circuit. Usually, also, an adjustable self-induction coil in series with the circuit has been employed in these experiments. When the tension of the currents is very high, the magnet ordinarily used in connection with the discharger is of comparatively small value, as it is quite easy to adjust the dimensions of the circuit so that oscillation is maintained. The employment of a steady e. m. f. in the high frequency conversion affords some advantages over the employment of alternating e. m. f., as the adjustments are much simpler and the action can be easier controlled. But unfortunately one is limited by the obtainable potential difference.</p></div> </div>
