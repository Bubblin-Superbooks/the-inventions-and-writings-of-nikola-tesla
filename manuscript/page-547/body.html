<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In all the last described experiments, tubes devoid of any electrodes may be used, and there is no difficulty in producing by their means sufficient light to read by. The light effect is, however, considerably increased by the use of phosphorescent bodies such as yttria, uranium glass, etc. A difficulty will be found when the phosphorescent material is used, for with these powerful effects, it is carried gradually away, and it is preferable to use material in the form of a solid.</p><p>Instead of depending on induction at a distance to light the tube, the same may be provided with an external&mdash;and, if desired, also with an internal&mdash;condenser coating, and it may then be suspended anywhere in the room from a conductor connected to one terminal of the coil, and in this manner a soft illumination may be provided.</p></div> </div>
