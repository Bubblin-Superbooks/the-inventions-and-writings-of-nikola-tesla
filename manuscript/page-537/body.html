Obviously, in the two last-named cases, instead of connecting the wires to an insulated body, connections may be made to the ground.</p><p>The experiments which will prove most suggestive and of most interest to the investigator are probably those performed with exhausted tubes. As might be anticipated, a source of such rapidly alternating potentials is capable of exciting the tubes at a considerable distance, and the light effects produced are remarkable.</p><p>Fig. 123.</p><p>During my investigations in this line I endeavored to excite tubes, devoid of any electrodes, by electromagnetic induction, making the tube the secondary of the induction device, and passing through the primary the discharges of a Leyden jar.</p></div> </div>
