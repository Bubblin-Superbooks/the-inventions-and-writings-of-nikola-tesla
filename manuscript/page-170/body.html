<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Assuming the generator to be running, and that it is desired to start the motor, the switch is shifted until its levers rest upon points 1 and 3. The two motor-circuits are thus connected with the generator circuit; but by reason of the presence of the resistance I in one and the self-induction coil J in the other the coincidence of the phases of the current is disturbed sufficiently to produce a progression of the poles, which starts the motor in rotation. When the speed of the motor has run up to synchronism with the generator, or approximately so, the switch is shifted over upon the points 2 and 4, thus cutting out the coils I and J, so that the currents in both circuits have the same phase; but the motor now runs as a synchronous motor.</p></div> </div>
