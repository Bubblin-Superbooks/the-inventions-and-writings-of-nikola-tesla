<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This is due to the fact that the maximum magnetic effects produced in the field and armature more nearly coincide. On this principle Mr. Tesla constructs a motor having independent field circuits of different self-induction, which are joined in derivation to a source of alternating currents. The armature is wound with one or more coils, which are connected with the field coils through contact rings and brushes, and around the armature coils a shunt is arranged with means for opening or closing the same. In starting this motor the shunt is closed around the armature coils, which will therefore be in closed circuit. When the current is directed through the motor, it divides between the two circuits, (it is not necessary to consider any case where there are more than two circuits used), which, by reason of their different self-induction, secure a difference of phase between the two currents in the two branches, that produces a shifting or rotation of the poles.</p></div> </div>
