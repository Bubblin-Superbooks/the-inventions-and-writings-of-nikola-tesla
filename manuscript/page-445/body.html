He pointed out also that the skin effect is largely modified by the presence of the gas or of an atomic medium in general. He showed also some interesting experiments in which the effect of convection is illustrated. Probably one of the most curious experiments in this connection is that in which a thin platinum wire stretched along the axis of an exhausted tube is brought to incandescence at certain points corresponding to the position of the stri&aelig;, while at others it remains dark. This experiment throws an interesting light upon the nature of the stri&aelig; and may lead to important revelations.</p><p>Mr. Tesla also demonstrated the dissipation of energy through an atomic medium and dwelt upon the behavior of vacuous space in</p></div> </div>
