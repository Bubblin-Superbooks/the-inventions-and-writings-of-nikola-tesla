<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I will now endeavor to show you some of the most noteworthy of these discharge phenomena.</p><p>I have stretched across the room two ordinary cotton covered wires, each about seven metres in length. They are supported on insulating cords at a distance of about thirty centimetres. I attach now to each of the terminals of the coil one of the wires, and set the coil in action. Upon turning the lights off in the room you see the wires strongly illuminated by the streams issuing abundantly from their whole surface in spite of the cotton covering, which may even be very thick. When the experiment is performed under good conditions, the light from the wires is sufficiently intense to allow distinguishing the objects in a room. To produce the best result it is, of course, necessary to adjust carefully the capacity of the jars, the arc between the knobs and the length of the wires.</p></div> </div>
