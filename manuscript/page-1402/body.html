<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If the disc be rotated and the field current interrupted, the current through the armature will continue to flow and the field magnets will lose their strength comparatively slowly. The reason for this will at once appear when we consider the direction of the currents set up in the disc.</p><p>Fig. 292.</p><p>Referring to the diagram Fig. 292, d represents the disc with the sliding contacts B B' on the shaft and periphery. N and S represent the two poles of a magnet. If the pole N be above, as indicated in the diagram, the disc being supposed to be in the plane of the paper, and rotating in the direction of the arrow D, the current set up in the disc will flow from the centre to the periphery, as indicated by the arrow A. Since the magnetic action is more or less confined to the space between the poles N S, the other portions of the disc may be considered inactive.</p></div> </div>
