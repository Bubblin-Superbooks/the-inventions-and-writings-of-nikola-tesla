<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It is very desirable to have the e. m. f. as high as possible, first, in order to increase the economy of the conversion, and, secondly, to obtain high frequencies. The difference of potential in this electric oscillation is, of course, the equivalent of the stretching force in the mechanical vibration of the spring. To obtain very rapid vibration in a circuit of some inertia, a great stretching force or difference of potential is necessary. Incidentally, when the e. m. f. is very great, the condenser which is usually employed in connection with the circuit need but have a small capacity, and many other advantages are gained. With a view of raising the e. m. f. to a many times greater value than obtainable from ordinary distribution circuits, a rotating transformer g is used, as indicated at IIa, Fig. 165, or else a separate high potential machine is driven by means of a motor operated from the generator G.</p></div> </div>
