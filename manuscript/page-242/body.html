In either case rotation will be produced; but unless the disc is provided with the closed energizing coils it is desirable that the above-described difference of magnetic susceptibility be utilized to assist in its rotation.</p><p>The cores of the field and armature may be made in various ways, as will be well understood, it being only requisite that the laminations in each be in such direction as to secure the necessary angular displacement of the points of greatest attraction.</p></div> </div>
