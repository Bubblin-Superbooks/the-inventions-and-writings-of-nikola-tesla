<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Figs. 72 and 73.</p><p>Referring to Fig. 72, let X represent a large iron core, which may be composed of a number of sheets or lamin&aelig; of soft iron or steel. Surrounding this core is a coil Y, which is connected with a source E of rapidly varying currents. Let us consider now the magnetic conditions existing in this core at any point, as b, at or near the centre, and any other point, as a, nearer the surface. When a current impulse is started in the magnetizing coil Y, the section or part at a, being close to the coil, is immediately energized, while the section or part at b, which, to use a convenient expression, is "protected" by the intervening sections or layers between a and b, does not at once exhibit its magnetism. However, as the magnetization of a increases, b becomes also affected, reaching finally its maximum strength some time later than a.</p></div> </div>
