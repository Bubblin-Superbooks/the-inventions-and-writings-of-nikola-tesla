By this means the main armature is more easily brought to or above the required speed. When the speed necessary for synchronism is imparted to the main motor, the current is shifted from the torque motor into the other.</p><p>Fig. 78.Fig. 79.</p><p>A convenient arrangement for carrying out this invention is shown in Fig. 80, in which J J are the field coils of the synchronizing, and H I the field coils of the torque motor. L L' are the conductors of the main line. One end of, say, coils H is connected to wire L through a self-induction coil M. One end of the other set of coils I is connected to the same wire through a dead resistance N.</p></div> </div>
