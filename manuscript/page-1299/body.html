<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In order to effect the adjustment with greater precision, the core I is provided with a small iron screw, s'. The core being first brought very nearly in the required position relatively to the solenoid by means of the screw s, the small screw s' is then adjusted until the magnetic attraction upon the core is the same when the core is in any position. A convenient stop, t, serves to limit the upward movement of the iron core.</p><p>To check somewhat the movement of the core I, a dash-pot, K, is used. The piston L of the dash-pot is provided with a valve, V, which opens by a downward pressure and allows an easy downward movement of the iron core I, but closes and checks the movement of the core when it is pulled up by the action of the solenoid.</p></div> </div>
