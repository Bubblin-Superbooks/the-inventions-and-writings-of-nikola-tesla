<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 225 is an instance of what may be called, in distinction to the others, a "magnetic" means of securing the result. V and W are two strong permanent magnets provided with armatures V' W', respectively. The armatures are made of thin lamin&aelig; of soft iron or steel, and the amount of magnetic metal which they contain is so calculated that they will be fully or nearly saturated by the magnets. Around the armatures are coils E F, contained, respectively, in the circuits C and D. The connections and electrical conditions in this case are similar to those in Fig. 221, except that the current source of I, Fig. 221, is dispensed with and the saturation of the core of coils E F obtained from the permanent magnets.</p></div> </div>
