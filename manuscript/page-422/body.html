<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As many important results are dependant upon the correctness of the estimation of the vibration period, this subject demands the most careful scrutiny of investigators.</p><p>In Leyden jars the loss due to the presence of air is comparatively small, principally on account of the great surface of the coatings and the small external action, but if there are streamers on the top, the loss may be considerable, and the period of vibration is affected. In a resonator, the density is small, but the frequency is extreme, and may introduce a considerable error. It appears certain, at any rate, that the periods of vibration of a charged body in a gaseous and in a continuous medium, such as oil, are different, on account of the action of the former, as explained.</p></div> </div>
