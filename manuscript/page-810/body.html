It is necessary to observe this rule if it is desired to use the apparatus to advantage.</p><p>By means of this arrangement I was able to proceed very quickly, and when the apparatus was in perfect order it was possible to reach the phosphorescent stage in a small bulb in less than fifteen minutes, which is certainly very quick work for a small laboratory arrangement requiring all in all about 100 pounds of mercury.</p></div> </div>
