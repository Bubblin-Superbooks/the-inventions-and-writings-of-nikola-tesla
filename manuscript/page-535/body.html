<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When a lamp is lighted by connecting it to one terminal only of the source, this may be facilitated by providing the globe with an outside condenser coating, which serves at the same time as a reflector, and connecting this to an insulated body of some size. Lamps of this kind are illustrated in Fig. 122 and Fig. 123. Fig. 124 shows the plan of connection. The brilliancy of the lamp may, in this case, be regulated within wide limits by varying the size of the insulated metal plate to which the coating is connected.</p><p>It is likewise practicable to light with one leading wire lamps such as illustrated in Fig. 116 and Fig. 117, by connecting one terminal of the lamp to one terminal of the source, and the other to an insulated body of the required size.</p></div> </div>
