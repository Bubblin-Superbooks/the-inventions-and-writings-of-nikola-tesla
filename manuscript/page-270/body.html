Furthermore, in order to approximate the magnetic quantities of the poles excited by these coils, Mr. Tesla employs in the self-induction circuit cores much longer than those in the other or resistance circuit.</p><p>Fig. 65 is a part sectional view of the motor at right angles to the shaft. Fig. 66 is a diagram of the field circuits.</p><p>In Fig. 66, let A represent the coils in one motor circuit, and B those in the other. The circuit A is to have the higher self-induction. There are, therefore, used a long length or a large number of turns of coarse wire in forming the coils of this circuit. For the circuit B, a smaller conductor is employed, or a conductor of a higher resistance than copper, such as German silver or iron, and the coils are wound with fewer turns.</p></div> </div>
