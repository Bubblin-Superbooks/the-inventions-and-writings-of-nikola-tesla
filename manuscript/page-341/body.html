<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The motor being started in operation and the coils of the field magnets being traversed by alternating currents, currents are induced in the armature coils by one set of field coils, as B, and the poles thus established are acted upon by the other set, as C. The armature coils, however, have necessarily a high self-induction, which opposes the flow of the currents thus set up. The condenser F not only permits the passage or transference of these currents, but also counteracts the effects of self-induction, and by a proper adjustment of the capacity of the condenser, the self-induction of the coils, and the periods of the currents, the condenser may be made to overcome entirely the effect of self-induction.</p><p>It is preferable on account of the undesirability of using sliding contacts of any kind, to associate the condenser with the armature directly, or make it a part of the armature.</p></div> </div>
