<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The conductor D is shown in this figure in section a a' designating the radial portions of the conductor, and b the insulating divisions between them. The relative width of the parts a a' and the space between any two adjacent points N N or S S is such that when the radial portions a of the conductor are passing between the opposite points N S where the field is strongest, the intermediate radial portions a' are passing through the widest spaces midway between such points and where the field is weakest. Since the core on one side is of opposite polarity to the part facing it, all the projections of one polar face will be of opposite polarity to those of the other face.</p></div> </div>
