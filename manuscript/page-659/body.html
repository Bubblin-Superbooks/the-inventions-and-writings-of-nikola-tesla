It is of the greatest importance that the sphere s be placed in the centre of the globe L.</p><p>Figs. 143, 144 and 145 indicate different forms, or stages, of the brush. Fig. 143 shows the brush as it first appears in a bulb provided with a conducting terminal; but, as in such a bulb it very soon disappears&mdash;often after a few minutes&mdash;I will confine myself to the description of the phenomenon as seen in a bulb without conducting electrode. It is observed under the following conditions:</p><p>When the globe L (Figs. 141 and 142) is exhausted to a very high degree, generally the bulb is not excited upon connecting the wire w (Fig. 141) or the tinfoil coating of the bulb (Fig. 142) to the terminal of the induction coil.</p></div> </div>
