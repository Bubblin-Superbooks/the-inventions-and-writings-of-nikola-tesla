<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the first chapters of this section we have, bearing in mind the broad underlying principle, considered a distinct class of motors, namely, such as require for their operation a special generator capable of yielding currents of differing phase. As a matter of course, Mr. Tesla recognizing the desirability of utilizing his motors in connection with ordinary systems of distribution, addressed himself to the task of inventing various methods and ways of achieving this object. In the succeeding chapters, therefore, we witness the evolution of a number of ideas bearing upon this important branch of work. It must be obvious to a careful reader, from a number of hints encountered here and there, that even the inventions described in these chapters to follow do not represent the full scope of the work done in these lines. They might, indeed, be regarded as exemplifications.</p></div> </div>
