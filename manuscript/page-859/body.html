<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Thus one is led, from theoretical and practical considerations, to the use of high frequencies, and this means high electromotive forces and small currents in the primary. When one works with condenser charges&mdash;and they are the only means up to the present known for reaching these extreme frequencies&mdash;one gets to electromotive forces of several thousands of volts per turn of the primary. We cannot multiply the electro-dynamic inductive effect by taking more turns in the primary, for we arrive at the conclusion that the best way is to work with one single turn&mdash;though we must sometimes depart from this rule&mdash;and we must get along with whatever inductive effect we can obtain with one turn. But before one has long experimented with the extreme frequencies required to set up in a small bulb an electromotive force of several thousands of volts, one realizes the great importance of electrostatic effects, and these effects grow relatively to the electro-dynamic in significance as the frequency is increased.</p></div> </div>
