<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Figs. 221, 222, 223, and 224 illustrate what may termed "electro-magnetic" devices for accomplishing a similar result&mdash;that is to say, instead of producing directly by a generator an electromotive force in each branch of the circuit, Mr. Tesla establishes a field or fields of force and leads the branches through the same in such manner that an active opposition of opposite effect or direction will be developed therein by the passage, or tendency to pass, of the alternations of current. In Fig. 221, for example, A is the generator of alternating currents, B B the line circuit, and C D the branches over which the alternating currents are directed. In each branch is included the secondary of a transformer or induction coil, which, since they correspond in their functions to the batteries of the previous figure, are designated by the letters E F.</p></div> </div>
