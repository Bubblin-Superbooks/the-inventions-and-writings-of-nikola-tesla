<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the preceding example, the glass being perfectly closed, it would mean that the dielectric in the discharge space possesses a great insulating power; the glass being cracked, it would signify that the medium in the space is a good conductor. The dielectric should vary enormously in resistance by minute variations of the e. m. f. across the discharge space. This condition is attained, but in an extremely imperfect manner, by warming the air space to a certain critical temperature, dependent on the e. m. f. across the gap, or by otherwise impairing the insulating power of the air. But as a matter of fact the air does never break down disruptively, if this term be rigorously interpreted, for before the sudden rush of the current occurs, there is always a weak current preceding it, which rises first gradually and then with comparative suddenness.</p></div> </div>
