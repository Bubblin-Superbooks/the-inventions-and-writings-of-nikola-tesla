<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It is a mere question of the dimensions and character of the apparatus to produce any degree of heating desired.</p><p>It has occurred to me whether, with such apparatus properly prepared, it would not be possible for a skilled physician to find in it a means for the effective treatment of various types of disease. The heating will, of course, be superficial, that is, on the skin, and would result, whether the person operated on were in bed or walking around a room, whether dressed in thick clothes or whether reduced to nakedness. In fact, to put it broadly, it is conceivable that a person entirely nude at the North Pole might keep himself comfortably warm in this manner.</p></div> </div>
