Hence, the further step&mdash;viz., the connection between the induced or generating coils of the machine and the contact-rings from which the currents are to be taken off&mdash;will be determined solely by what order of variations of strength and direction in the currents is desired for producing a given result in the electrical translating device. This may be accomplished in various ways; but in the drawings we give typical instances only of the best and most practicable ways of applying the invention to three of the leading types of machines in widespread use, in order to illustrate the principle.</p></div> </div>
