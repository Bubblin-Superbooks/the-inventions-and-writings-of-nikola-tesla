The magnet N, S, can be in this case advantageously combined with the air space. The discharger d d with the magnet may be placed either way, as indicated by the full or by the dotted lines. The circuit Ia with the connections and devices is supposed to possess dimensions such as are suitable for the maintenance of a vibration. But usually the e. m. f. on the circuit or branch Ia will be something like a 100 volts or so, and in this case it is not sufficient to break through the gap. Many different means may be used to remedy this by raising the e. m. f. across the gap.</p></div> </div>
