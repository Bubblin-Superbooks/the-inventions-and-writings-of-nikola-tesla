<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> At the same time, the magnetic circuit of the other induction device being broken by the position of the armature O, there will be less opposition to the current in coils M, which will shunt the current from branch C. A reversal of the current being attended by a shifting of the armatures, the opposite effect is produced.</p><p>Other modifications of these methods are possible, but need not be pointed out. In all these plans, it will be observed, there is developed in one or all of these branches of a circuit from a source of alternating currents, an active (as distinguished from a dead) resistance or opposition to the currents of one sign, for the purpose of diverting the currents of that sign through the other or another path, but permitting the currents of opposite sign to pass without substantial opposition.</p></div> </div>
