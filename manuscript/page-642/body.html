There seems not to be a very great difference whatever kind of oil is used; I use paraffine or linseed oil.</p><p>To exclude more perfectly the air, an excellent way to proceed, and easily practicable with small coils, is the following: Construct a box of hardwood of very thick boards which have been for a long time boiled in oil. The boards should be so joined as to safely withstand the external air pressure. The coil being placed and fastened in position within the box, the latter is closed with a strong lid, and covered with closely fitting metal sheets, the joints of which are soldered very carefully. On the top two small holes are drilled, passing through the metal sheet and the wood, and in these holes two small glass tubes are inserted and the joints made air-tight.</p></div> </div>
