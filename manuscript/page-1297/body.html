The ends of the coils are connected to binding-posts s s, which are in electrical connection with metal plates t t within the recesses in the two parts S T. These chambers or recesses are filled with mercury, and in the collector part are tubes W W, with screws w w, carrying springs X and pistons X', which compensate for the expansion and contraction of the mercury under varying temperatures, but which are sufficiently strong not to yield to the pressure of the fluid due to centrifugal action, and which serve as binding-posts.</p><p>In all the above cases the commutators are adapted for a single coil, and the device is particularly suited to such purposes. The number of segments may be increased, however, or more than one commutator used with a single armature.</p></div> </div>
