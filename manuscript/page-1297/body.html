Fig. 266 is an elevation of the regulator with the frame partly in section; and Fig. 267 is a section at the line x x, Fig. 266. C is the commutator; B and B', the brush-holders, B carrying the main brushes a a', and B' the auxiliary or shunt brushes b b. The axis of the brush-holder B is supported by two pivot-screws, p p. The other brush-holder, B', has a sleeve, d, and is movable around the axis of the brush-holder B.</p></div> </div>
