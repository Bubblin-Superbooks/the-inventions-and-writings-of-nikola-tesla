<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As long as the electrical connection is not good, the conducting tube is always of some advantage, for although it may not greatly economize energy, still it protects the support of the refractory button, and is the means of concentrating more energy upon the same.</p><p>To whatever extent the aluminum tube performs the function of a screen, its usefulness is therefore limited to very high degrees of exhaustion when it is insulated from the electrode&mdash;that is, when the gas as a whole is non-conducting, and the molecules, or atoms, act as independent carriers of electric charges.</p><p>In addition to acting as a more or less effective screen, in the true meaning of the word, the conducting tube or coating may also act, by reason of its conductivity, as a sort of equalizer or dampener of the bombardment against the stem.</p></div> </div>
