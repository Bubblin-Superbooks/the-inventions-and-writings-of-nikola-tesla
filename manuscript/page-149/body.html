<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In Fig. 28, let C represent a cylindrical armature core wound longitudinally with insulated coils A A, which are connected up in series, the terminals of the series being connected to collecting-rings a a on the shaft G. By means of this shaft the armature is mounted to rotate between the poles of an annular field-magnet D, formed with polar projections wound with coils E, that magnetize the said projections. The coils E are included in the circuit of a generator F, by means of which the field-magnet is energized. If thus constructed, the machine is a well-known form of alternating-current generator. To adapt it to his system, however, Mr. Tesla winds on armature C a second set of coils B B intermediate to the first, or, in other words, in such positions that while the coils of one set are in the relative positions to the poles of the field-magnet to produce the</p></div> </div>
