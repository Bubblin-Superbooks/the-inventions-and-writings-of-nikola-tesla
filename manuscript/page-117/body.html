<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There is another well-known type of machine in which three or more coils, A' B' C', on the armature have a common joint, the free ends being connected to the segments of a commutator. This form of generator is illustrated in Fig. 27. In this case each terminal of the generator is connected directly or in derivation to a continuous ring, a b c, and collecting brushes, a' b' c', bearing thereon, take off the alternating currents that operate the motor. It is preferable in this case to employ a motor or transformer with three energizing coils, A'' B'' C'', placed symmetrically with those of the generator, and the circuits from the latter are connected to the terminals of such coils either directly&mdash;as when they are stationary&mdash;or by means of brushes e' and contact rings e.</p></div> </div>
