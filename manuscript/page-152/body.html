The coils B are connected, also, in series and to two connecting-rings, secured generally to the shaft at the opposite end of the armature.</p><p>Fig. 30.</p><p>Fig. 31.</p><p>The motor shown in Fig. 29 has an annular field-magnet H, with four pole-pieces wound with coils I. The armature is constructed similarly to the generator, but with two sets of two coils in closed circuits to correspond with the reduced number of magnetic poles in the field. From the foregoing it is evident that one revolution of the armature of the generator producing eight current impulses in each circuit will produce two revolutions of the motor-armature.</p></div> </div>
