<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It will be observed that when in this position and with lever F' on contact 8 the current divides between the two circuits B C, which from their difference in electrical character produce a progression of the poles that starts the motor in rotation. When the motor has attained the proper speed, the switch is shifted so that the levers cover the contacts 7 and 9, thereby connecting circuits B and C in series. It is found that by this disposition the motor is maintained in rotation in synchronism with the generator. This principle of operation, which consists in converting by a change of connections or otherwise a double-circuit motor, or one operating by a progressive shifting of the poles, into an ordinary synchronizing motor may be carried out in many other ways.</p></div> </div>
