The currents in both primary and secondary coils in such a motor will be retarded or will lag behind the impressed electromotive force; but to secure a proper difference in phase between the primary and secondary currents themselves, Mr. Tesla increases the resistance of the circuit of the secondary and reduces as much as practicable its self-induction. This is done by using for the secondary circuit, particularly in the coils E, wire of comparatively small diameter and having but few turns around the cores; or by using some conductor of higher specific resistance, such as German silver; or by introducing at some point in the secondary circuit an artificial resistance R.</p></div> </div>
