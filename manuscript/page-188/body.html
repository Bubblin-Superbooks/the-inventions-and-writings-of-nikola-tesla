Its actual speed, therefore, may be faster or slower than that of the generator; but it is said to be synchronous so long as it preserves the same relative speed.</p><p>In carrying out this invention Mr. Tesla constructs a motor which has a strong tendency to synchronism with the generator. The construction preferred is that in which the armature is provided with polar projections.</p></div> </div>
