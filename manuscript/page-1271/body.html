<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In Fig. 235 is shown a helix, Q, with an armature adapted to swing toward or from the helix. In this case there may be a soft-iron core in the helix, or the armature may assume the form of a solenoid core, there being no permanent core within the helix.</p><p>Fig. 237.Fig. 238.Fig. 239.</p><p>Fig. 236 is an end view, and Fig. 237 a plan view, illustrating the method as applied to a swinging armature, A, and a stationary permanent magnet, N S. In this instance Mr. Tesla applies the heat to an auxiliary armature or keeper, T, which is adjacent to and preferably in direct contact with the magnet. This armature T, in the form of a plate of sheet-iron, extends across from one pole to the other and is of sufficient section to practically form a keeper for the magnet, so that when the armature T is cool nearly all the lines of force pass over the same and very little free magnetism is exhibited.</p></div> </div>
