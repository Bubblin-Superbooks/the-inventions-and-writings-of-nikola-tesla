<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I may add that in one of my experiments in which a vacuum was produced by the Torricellian method, I was unable to produce the luminous band, but this may have been due to the weak exciting current employed.</p><p>My principal argument is the following: I have experimentally proved that if the same discharge which is barely sufficient to excite a luminous band in the bulb when passed through the primary circuit be so directed as to exalt the electrostatic inductive effect&mdash;namely, by converting upwards&mdash;an exhausted tube, devoid of electrodes, may be excited at a distance of several feet.</p></div> </div>
