Usually in bulbs constructed as shown in Fig. 162 an aluminum tube a was fastened to the upper end s of each of the tubes t and t1 in order to protect that end against the heat. The buttons m and m1 could be brought to any degree of incandescence by passing the discharges of Leyden jars around the coil C. In such bulbs with two buttons a very curious effect is produced by the formation of the shadows of each of the two buttons.</p><p>Another line of experiment, which has been assiduously followed, was to induce by electro-dynamic induction a current or luminous discharge</p></div> </div>
