<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In order to develop economically an electromotive force available for practicable purposes, it is necessary either to rotate the conductor at a very high rate of speed or to use a disc of large diameter or a cylinder of great length; but in either case it becomes difficult to secure and maintain a good electrical connection between the collecting brushes and the conductor, owing to the high peripheral speed.</p><p>It has been proposed to couple two or more discs together in series, with the object of obtaining a higher electro-motive force; but with the connections heretofore used and using other conditions of speed and dimension of disc necessary to securing good practicable results, this difficulty is still felt to be a serious obstacle to the use of this kind of generator. These objections Mr. Tesla has sought to avoid by constructing a machine with two fields, each having a rotary conductor mounted between its poles.</p></div> </div>
