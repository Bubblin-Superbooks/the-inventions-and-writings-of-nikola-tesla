As soon as this happens, the current through the part p' is interrupted, and the whole current passes through the part x. The magnet M is now strongly magnetized, the armature g is attracted, and the rod clamped. At the same time the armature lever L is pulled down out of its normal position and the arc started. In this way the lamp cuts itself out automatically when the arc gets too long, and reinserts itself automatically in the circuit if the carbons drop together.</p></div> </div>
