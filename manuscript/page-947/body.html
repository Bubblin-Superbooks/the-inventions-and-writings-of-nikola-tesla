<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It is deemed advisable to make the preceding remarks, inasmuch as many more recently described effects have been unwittingly identified with high frequencies. Frequency alone in reality does not mean anything, except when an undisturbed harmonic oscillation is considered.</p><p>In the branch IIIb a similar disposition to that in Ib is illustrated, with the difference that the currents discharging through the gap d d are used to induce currents in the secondary S of a transformer T. In such case the secondary should be provided with an adjustable condenser for the purpose of tuning it to the primary.</p><p>IIb illustrates a plan of alternate current high frequency conversion which is most frequently used and which is found to be most convenient. This plan has been dwelt upon in detail on previous occasions and need not be described here.</p></div> </div>
