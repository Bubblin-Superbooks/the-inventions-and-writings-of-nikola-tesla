It appeared from rough estimation that an oxygen tube when excited under similar conditions&mdash;that is, as far as could be determined&mdash;gives more light; but this, of course, may be due to many causes.</p><p>Without doubting in the least that, with the care and precautions taken by Prof. J. J. Thomson, the luminosity excited was due solely to electrodynamic action, I would say that in many experiments I have observed curious instances of the ineffectiveness of the screening, and I have also found that the electrification through the air is often of very great importance, and may, in some cases, determine the excitation of the tube.</p></div> </div>
