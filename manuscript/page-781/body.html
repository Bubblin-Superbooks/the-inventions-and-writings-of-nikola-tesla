How does the earth behave? The earth is an air condenser, but is it a perfect or a very imperfect one&mdash;a mere sink of energy? There can be little doubt that to such small disturbance as might be caused in an experiment, the earth behaves as an almost perfect condenser. But it might be different when its charge is set in vibration by some sudden disturbance occurring in the heavens. In such case, as before stated, probably only little of the energy of the vibrations set up would be lost into space in the form of long ether radiations, but most of the energy, I think, would spend itself in molecular impacts and collisions, and pass off into space in the form of short heat, and possibly light, waves.</p></div> </div>
