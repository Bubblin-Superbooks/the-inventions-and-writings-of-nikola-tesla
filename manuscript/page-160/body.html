<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In this instance, the generator which supplies the current for operating the motors or transformers consists of a subdivided ring or annular core wound with four diametrically-opposite coils, E E', Fig. 33. Within the ring is mounted a cylindrical armature-core wound longitudinally with two independent coils, F F', the ends of which lead, respectively, to two pairs of insulated contact or collecting rings, D D' G G', on the armature shaft. Collecting brushes d d' g g' bear upon these rings, respectively, and convey the currents through the two independent line-circuits M M'. In the main line there may be included one or more motors or transformers, or both. If motors be used, they are of the usual form of Tesla construction with independent coils or sets of coils J J', included, respectively, in the circuits M M'.</p></div> </div>
