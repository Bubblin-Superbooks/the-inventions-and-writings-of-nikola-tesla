In the construction of such apparatus as motors which are designed to be run by alternating or equivalent currents&mdash;such as pulsating or undulating currents generally&mdash;Mr. Tesla found it desirable and even necessary to give due consideration to this phenomenon and to make special provisions in order to obviate its consequences. With the specific object of taking advantage of this action or effect, and to render it more pronounced, he constructs a field magnet in which the parts of the core or cores that exhibit at different intervals of time the magnetic effect imparted to them by</p></div> </div>
