Assume, for example, that these devices are batteries, primary or secondary, or continuous current dynamo machines. The waves or impulses of opposite direction composing the main current have a natural tendency to divide between the two branches; but by reason of the opposite electrical character or effect of the two branches, one will offer an easy passage to a current of a certain direction, while the other will offer a relatively high resistance to the passage of the same current. The result of this disposition is, that the waves of current of one sign will, partly or wholly, pass over one of the paths or branches, while those of the opposite sign pass over the other.</p></div> </div>
