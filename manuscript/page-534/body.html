<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Such lamps have been operated by me with current impulses of the enormous frequencies obtainable by the disruptive discharge of condensers.</p><p>The disruptive discharge of a condenser is especially suited for operating such lamps&mdash;with no outward electrical connections&mdash;by means of electromagnetic induction, the electromagnetic inductive effects being excessively high; and I have been able to produce the desired incandescence with only a few short turns of wire. Incandescence may also be produced in this manner in a simple closed filament.</p><p>Leaving now out of consideration the practicability of such lamps, I would only say that they possess a beautiful and desirable feature, namely, that they can be rendered, at will, more or less brilliant simply by altering the relative position of the outside and inside condenser coatings, or inducing and induced circuits.</p></div> </div>
