<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>If the field or energizing circuits of a rotary phase motor be both derived from the same source of alternating currents and a condenser of proper capacity be included in one of the same, approximately, the desired difference of phase may be obtained between the currents flowing directly from the source and those flowing through the condenser; but the great size and expense of condensers for this purpose that would meet the requirements of the ordinary systems of comparatively low potential are particularly prohibitory to their employment.</p><p>Another, now well-known, method or plan of securing a difference of phase between the energizing currents of motors of this kind is to induce by the currents in one circuit those in the other circuit or circuits; but as no means had been proposed that would secure in this way between the phases of the primary or inducing and the secondary or induced currents that difference&mdash;</p></div> </div>
