Instead of making the inside bulb large, in order to avoid undue heating, it answers the purpose to make the electrode m larger. In this case the bombardment is weakened by reason of the smaller electric density.</p><p>Many bulbs were constructed on the plan illustrated in Fig. 158. Here a small bulb b, containing the refractory button m, upon being exhausted to a very high degree was sealed in a large globe L, which was then moderately exhausted and sealed off. The principal advantage of this construction was that it allowed of reaching extremely high vacua, and, at the same time of using a large bulb. It was found, in the course of experiments with bulbs such as illustrated in Fig.</p></div> </div>
