<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In branch C are included two primary coils E E', and in branch D are two similar primaries F F' The corresponding secondaries for these coils and which are on the same subdivided cores J or J', are in circuits the terminals of which connect to opposite segments K K', and L L', respectively, of a commutator. Brushes b b bear upon the commutator and alternately short-circuit the plates K and K', and L and L', through a connection c. It is obvious that either the magnets and commutator, or the brushes, may revolve.</p><p>Fig. 222.</p><p>The operation will be understood from a consideration of the effects of closing or short-circuiting the secondaries. For example, if at the instant when a given wave of current passes, one set of secondaries be short-circuited, nearly all the current flows through the corresponding primaries;</p></div> </div>
