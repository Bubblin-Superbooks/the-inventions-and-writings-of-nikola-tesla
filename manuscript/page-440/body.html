<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Throughout his discourse one can trace Mr. Tesla's effort to present in a popular way thoughts and views on the electrical phenomena which have in recent years captivated the scientific world, but of which the general public has even yet merely received an inkling. Mr. Tesla also dwells rather extensively on his well-known method of high-frequency conversion; and the large amount of detail information will be gratefully received by students and experimenters in this virgin field. The employment of apt analogies in explaining the fundamental principles involved makes it easy for all to gain a clear idea of their nature. Again, the ease with which, thanks to Mr. Tesla's efforts, these high-frequency currents may now be obtained from circuits carrying almost any kind of current, cannot fail to result in an extensive broadening of this field of research, which offers so many possibilities.</p></div> </div>
