<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This effect is continued by the reversal of current, the polarities of field and armature being simply reversed. One or both of the elements&mdash;the armature or field&mdash;may be wound with closed induced coils to intensify this effect. Although in the illustrations but one of the fields is shown, each element of the motor really constitutes a field, wound with the closed coils, the currents being induced mainly in those convolutions or coils which are parallel to the coils F F.</p><p>Fig. 54.Fig. 55.</p><p>A modified form of this motor is shown in Fig. 56. In this form G is one of two standards that support the bearings for the armature-shaft. H H are uprights or sides of a frame, preferably magnetic, the ends C C' of which are bent in the manner indicated, to conform to the shape of the armature D and form field-magnet poles.</p></div> </div>
