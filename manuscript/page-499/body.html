<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the dark, when the brush is very powerful, the root may appear almost white. The wind produced by the escaping streams, though it may be very strong&mdash;often indeed to such a degree that it may be felt quite a distance from the coil&mdash;is, nevertheless, considering the quantity of the discharge, smaller than that produced by the positive brush of a static machine, and it affects the flame much less powerfully. From the nature of the phenomenon we can conclude that the higher the frequency, the smaller must, of course, be the wind produced by the streams, and with sufficiently high frequencies no wind at all would be produced at the ordinary atmospheric pressures. With frequencies obtainable by means of a machine, the mechanical effect is sufficiently great to revolve, with considerable speed, large pin-wheels, which in the dark present a beautiful appearance owing to the abundance of the streams (Fig. 106).</p></div> </div>
