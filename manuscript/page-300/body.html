<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Upon the weakening of the current the magnetization of a first diminishes, while b still exhibits its maximum strength; but the continued weakening of a is attended by a subsequent weakening of b. Assuming the current to be an alternating one, a will now be reversed, while b still continues of the first imparted polarity. This action continues the magnetic condition of b, following that of a in the manner above described. If an armature&mdash;for instance, a simple disc F, mounted to rotate freely on an axis&mdash;be brought into proximity to the core, a movement of rotation will be imparted to the disc, the direction depending upon its position relatively to the core, the tendency being to turn the portion of the disc nearest to the core from a to b, as indicated in Fig. 72.</p></div> </div>
