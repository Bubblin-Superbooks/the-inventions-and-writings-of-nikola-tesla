<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The free ends or terminals of the conductors are connected either in series in the circuit supplying the current to the lamps or other devices, or in parallel to a resistance in the circuit and in series with the current consuming devices. Under such circumstances a current passing through the conductors establishes a difference of potential between them which is proportional to the strength of the current, in consequence of which there is a leakage of current from one conductor to the other across the solution. The strength of this leakage current is proportional to the difference of potential, and, therefore, in proportion to the strength of the current passing through the conductors. Moreover, as there is a constant difference of potential between the two conductors throughout the entire extent that is exposed to the solution, the current density through such solution is the same at all corresponding points, and hence the deposit is uniform along the whole of one of the conductors, while the metal is taken away uniformly from the other.</p></div> </div>
