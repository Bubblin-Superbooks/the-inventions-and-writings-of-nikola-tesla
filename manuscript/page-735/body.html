<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> From many experiences I conclude that lamp filaments obtained in this manner can be advantageously used only with low potentials and low frequency currents. Some kinds of carbon withstand so well that, in order to bring them to the point of fusion, it is necessary to employ very small buttons. In this case the observation is rendered very difficult on account of the intense heat produced. Nevertheless there can be no doubt that all kinds of carbon are fused under the molecular bombardment, but the liquid state must be one of great instability. Of all the bodies tried there were two which withstood best&mdash;diamond and carborundum. These two showed up about equally, but the latter was preferable for many reasons. As it is more than likely that this body is not yet generally known, I will venture to call your attention to it.</p></div> </div>
