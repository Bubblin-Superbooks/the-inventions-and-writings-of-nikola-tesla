Second, if a circuit, the terminals of which are connected with the plates of the condenser, possess a certain self-induction, the condenser will overcome or counteract to a greater or less degree, dependent upon well-understood conditions, the effects of such self-induction. Third, if two points of a closed or complete circuit through which a rapidly rising and falling current flows be shunted or bridged by a condenser, a variation in the strength of the currents in the branches and also a difference of phase of the currents therein is produced.</p></div> </div>
