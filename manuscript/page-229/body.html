<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> On the start the coil F alone is active and the motor tends to run at a speed above the synchronous; but when the coil G is connected to the circuit the number of armature poles is increased, while the motor is made a true synchronous motor. This disposition has the advantage that the closed armature-circuit imparts to the motor torque when the speed falls off, but at the same time the conditions are such that the motor comes out of synchronism more readily. To increase the tendency to synchronism, two circuits may be used on the armature, one of which is short-circuited on the start and both connected with the external circuit after the synchronous speed is reached or passed. This disposition is shown in Fig. 53. There are three contact-rings a b e and three brushes c d f, which connect the armature circuits with the external circuit.</p></div> </div>
