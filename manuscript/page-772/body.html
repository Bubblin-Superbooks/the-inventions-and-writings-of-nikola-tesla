<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If an iron rod be held within a small helix, it is quickly brought to a high temperature, indicating the passage of a strong current through the helix. How does the insulated sphere act in this case? It can be a condenser, storing and returning the energy supplied to it, or it can be a mere sink of energy, and the conditions of the experiment determine whether it is rather one than the other. The sphere being charged to a high potential, it acts inductively upon the surrounding air, or whatever gaseous medium there might be. The molecules, or atoms, which are near the sphere, are of course more attracted, and move through a greater distance than the farther ones. When the nearest molecules strike the sphere, they are repelled, and collisions occur at all distances within the inductive action of the sphere.</p></div> </div>
