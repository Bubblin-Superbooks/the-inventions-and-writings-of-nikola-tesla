Earlier English investigators, to mention only Spottiswoode and J. E. H. Gordon, have used a rapid break in connection with the coil. Our knowledge and experience of to-day enables us to see clearly why these coils under the conditions of the test did not disclose any remarkable phenomena, and why able experimenters failed to perceive many of the curious effects which have since been observed.</p></div> </div>
