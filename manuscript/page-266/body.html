<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A motor thus constructed will rotate under the action of an alternating current; but as happens in the case previously described the corresponding magnetic effects of the armature and field do not coincide owing to the time that elapses between a given magnetic effect in the armature and the condition of the field that produces it. The secondary or supplemental poles B' C' are therefore availed of. There being thirty degrees difference of phase between the currents in coils D E, the magnetic effect of poles B' C' should correspond to that produced by a current differing from the current in coils D or E by fifteen degrees. This we can attain by winding each supplemental pole B' C' with two coils H H'.</p></div> </div>
