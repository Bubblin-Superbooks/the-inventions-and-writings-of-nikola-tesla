<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The terminals of these coils are connected, respectively, to four insulated contact or collecting rings, H H H' H', and the four line circuit wires L connect the brushes K, bearing on these rings, to the converter in the order shown. Noting the results of this combination, it will be observed that at a given point of time the coil G is in its neutral position and is generating little or no current, while the other coil, G', is in a position where it exerts its maximum effect. Assuming coil G to be connected in circuit with coils B B of the converter, and coil G' with coils B' B', it is evident that the poles of the ring A will be determined by coils B' B' alone; but as the armature of the generator revolves, coil G develops more current and coil G' less, until G reaches its maximum and G' its neutral position. The obvious result will be to shift the poles of the ring A through one-quarter of its periphery.</p></div> </div>
