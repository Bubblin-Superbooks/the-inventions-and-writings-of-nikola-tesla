<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In Fig. 153, for example, an experimental bulb, L, is shown, which is provided with a neck, n, on the top, for the application of an external tinfoil coating, which may be connected to a body of larger surface. Such a lamp as illustrated in Fig. 154 may also be lighted by connecting the tinfoil coating on the neck n to the terminal, and the leading-in wire, w, to an insulated plate. If the bulb stands in a socket upright, as shown in the cut, a shade of conducting material may be slipped in the neck, n, and the action thus magnified.</p><p>A more perfected arrangement used in some of these bulbs is illustrated in Fig. 155. In this case the construction of the bulb is as shown and described before, when reference was made to Fig. 148. A zinc sheet, Z, with a tubular extension, T, is applied over the metallic socket, S.</p></div> </div>
