<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> By combining with the brushes at a b c any automatic regulating mechanism, the current developed can be regulated automatically in proportion to the demands of the working circuit.</p><p>In Figs. 264 and 265 some of the automatic means are represented that maybe used for moving the brushes. The core P, Fig. 264, of the solenoid-helix S is connected with the brush a to move the same, and in Fig. 265 the core P is shown as within the helix S, and connected with brushes a and c, so as to move the same toward or from each other, according to the strength of the current in the helix, the helix being within an iron tube, S', that becomes magnetized and increases the action of the solenoid.</p></div> </div>
