Thirdly, the synchronizing motor may be constructed so as to have a much more pronounced tendency to synchronism without lessening the facility with which it is started.</p><p>Fig. 77 is a part sectional view of the two motors; Fig. 78 an end view of the synchronizing motor; Fig. 79 an end view and part section of the torque or double-circuit motor; Fig. 80 a diagram of the circuit connections employed; and Figs. 81, 82, 83, 84 and 85 are diagrams of modified dispositions of the two motors.</p></div> </div>
