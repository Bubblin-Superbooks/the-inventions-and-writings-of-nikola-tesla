<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The small hollow sphere s is filled with some conducting powder, and a wire w is cemented in the neck for the purpose of connecting the conducting powder with the generator.</p><p>The construction shown in Fig. 142 was chosen in order to remove from the brush any conducting body which might possibly affect it. The bulb consists in this case of a lamp globe L, which has a neck n, provided with a tube b and small sphere s, sealed to it, so that two entirely independent compartments are formed, as indicated in the drawing. When the bulb is in use the neck n is provided with a tinfoil coating, which is connected to the generator and acts inductively upon the moderately rarefied and highly conducted gas inclosed in the neck. From there the current passes through the tube b into the small sphere s, to act by induction upon the gas contained in the globe L.</p></div> </div>
