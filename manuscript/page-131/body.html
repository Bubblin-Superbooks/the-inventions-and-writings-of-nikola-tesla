<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 32 shows in diagram other forms of machine. The generator N in this case is shown as consisting of a stationary ring O, wound with twenty-four coils P P', alternate coils being connected in series in two circuits. Within this ring is a disc or drum Q, with projections Q' wound with energizing-coils included in circuit with a generator R. By driving this disc or cylinder alternating currents are produced in the coils P and P', which are carried off to run the several motors.</p><p>The motors are composed of a ring or annular field-magnet S, wound with two sets of energizing-coils T T', and armatures U, having projections U' wound with coils V, all connected in series in a closed circuit or each closed independently on itself.</p></div> </div>
