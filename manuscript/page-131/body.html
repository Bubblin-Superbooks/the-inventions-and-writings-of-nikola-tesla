<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The preceding descriptions have assumed the use of alternating current generators in which, in order to produce the progressive movement of the magnetic poles, or of the resultant attraction of independent field magnets, the current generating coils are independent or separate. The ordinary forms of continuous current dynamos may, however, be employed for the same work, in accordance with a method of adaptation devised by Mr. Tesla. As will be seen, the modification involves but slight changes in their construction, and presents other elements of economy.</p><p>On the shaft of a given generator, either in place of or in addition to the regular commutator, are secured as many pairs of insulated collecting-rings as there are circuits to be operated. Now, it will be understood that in the operation of any dynamo electric generator the currents in the coils in their movement through the field of force undergo different phases&mdash;</p></div> </div>
