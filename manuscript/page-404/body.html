Indications of such breaking down have been repeatedly observed, but they can be attributed to the fundamental disturbances, which are few in number, for the superimposed vibration would be so rapid as not to allow a disruptive break.</p><p>The study of these discharge phenomena has led Mr. Tesla to the recognition of some important facts. It was found, as already stated, that gaseous matter must be most carefully excluded from any dielectric which is subjected to great, rapidly changing electrostatic stresses. Since it is difficult to exclude the gas perfectly when solid insulators are used, it is necessary to resort to liquid dielectrics.</p></div> </div>
