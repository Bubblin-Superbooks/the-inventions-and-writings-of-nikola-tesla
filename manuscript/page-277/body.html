<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> These results Mr. Tesla obtains by using the same amount of copper or ampere turns in both elements when the cores of both are equal, or approximately so, and the same current energizes both; or in cases where the currents in one element are induced to those of the other he uses in the induced coils an excess of copper over that in the primary element or conductor.</p><p>Fig. 67.</p><p>The conventional figure of a motor here introduced, Fig. 67, will give an idea of the solution furnished by Mr. Tesla for the specific problem. Referring to the drawing, A is the field-magnet, B the armature, C the field coils, and D the armature-coils of the motor.</p></div> </div>
