<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> These coils are secondaries, in which currents of very high potential are induced. All the coils E in one series are connected, and all the secondaries F in another.</p><p>Fig. 91.</p><p>On the intermediate poles B are wound fine-wire energizing coils G, which are connected in series with one another, and also with the series of secondary coils F, the direction of winding being such that a current-impulse induced from the primary coils E imparts the same magnetism to the poles B as that produced in poles A by the primary impulse. This condition is indicated by the characters N' S'.</p><p>In the circuit formed by the two sets of coils F and G is introduced a condenser H; otherwise this circuit is closed upon itself, while the free ends of the circuit of coils E are connected to a source of alternating currents.</p></div> </div>
