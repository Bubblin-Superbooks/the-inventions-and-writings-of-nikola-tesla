<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The movement of the coils through the next quarter of a turn&mdash;during which coil G' enters a field of opposite polarity and generates a current of opposite direction and increasing strength, while coil G, in passing from its maximum to its neutral position generates a current of decreasing strength and same direction as before&mdash;causes a further shifting of the poles through the second quarter of the ring. The second half-revolution will obviously be a repetition of the same action. By the shifting of the poles of the ring A, a powerful dynamic inductive effect on the coils C C' is produced. Besides the currents generated in the secondary coils by dynamo-magnetic induction, other currents will be set up in the same coils in consequence of many variations in the intensity of the poles in the ring A.</p></div> </div>
