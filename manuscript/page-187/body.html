<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Hence, in all instances heretofore where these "synchronizing motors," as they are termed, have been run, some means have been adopted to bring the motors up to synchronism with the generator, or approximately so, before the alternating current of the generator is applied to drive them. In some instances mechanical appliances have been utilized for this purpose. In others special and complicated forms of motor have been constructed. Mr. Tesla has discovered a much more simple method or plan of operating synchronizing motors, which requires practically no other apparatus than the motor itself. In other words, by a certain change in the circuit connections of the motor he converts it at will from a double circuit motor, or such as have been already described, and which will start under the action of an alternating current, into a synchronizing motor, or one which will be run by the generator only when it has reached a certain speed of rotation synchronous with that of the generator.</p></div> </div>
