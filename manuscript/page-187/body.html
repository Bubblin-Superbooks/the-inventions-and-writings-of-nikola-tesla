<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Thus each motor-circuit while in derivation to the other includes one armature and one field coil. These circuits are of different self-induction, and may be made so in various ways. For the sake of clearness, an artificial resistance R is shown in one of these circuits, and in the other a self-induction coil S. When an alternating current is passed through this motor it divides between its two energizing-circuits. The higher self-induction of one circuit produces a greater retardation or lag in the current therein than in the other. The difference of phase between the two currents effects the rotation or shifting of the points of maximum magnetic effect that secures the rotation of the armature. In certain respects this plan of including both armature and field coils in circuit is a marked improvement.</p></div> </div>
