This changes the direction of the movement of the shifting poles which the armature follows.</p><p>One of the main advantages of this plan of regulation is its economy of power. When the induced coil is generating its maximum current, the maximum amount of energy in the primary coils is absorbed; but as the induced coil is turned from its normal position the self-induction of the primary-coils reduces the expenditure of energy and saves power.</p><p>It is obvious that in practice either coils C C or coil F may be used as primary or secondary, and it is well understood that their relative proportions may be varied to produce any desired difference or similarity in the inducing and induced currents.</p></div> </div>
