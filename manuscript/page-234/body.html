<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If an alternating current be passed through the coils F F, rotation of the armature will be produced, and this rotation is explained by the following apparent action, or mode of operation: An impulse of current in the coils F F establishes two polarities in the motor. The protruding end of pole-piece C, for instance, will be of one sign, and the corresponding end of pole-piece C' will be of the opposite sign. The armature also exhibits two poles at right angles to the coils F F, like poles to those in the pole-pieces being on the same side of the coils. While the current is flowing there is no appreciable tendency to rotation developed; but after each current impulse ceases or begins to fall, the magnetism in the armature and in the ends of the pole-pieces C C' lags or continues to manifest itself, which produces a rotation of the armature by the repellent force between the more closely approximating points of maximum magnetic effect.</p></div> </div>
