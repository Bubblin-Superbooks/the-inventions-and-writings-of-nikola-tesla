<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One of the most interesting results arrived at in pursuing these experiments, is the demonstration of the fact that a gaseous medium, upon which vibration is impressed by rapid changes of electrostatic potential, is rigid. In illustration of this result an experiment made by Mr. Tesla may by cited:&mdash;A glass tube about one inch in diameter and three feet long, with outside condenser coatings on the ends, was exhausted to a certain point, when, the tube being suspended freely from a wire connecting the upper coating to one of the terminals of the coil, the discharge appeared in the form of a luminous thread passing through the axis of the tube. Usually the thread was sharply defined in the upper part of the tube and lost itself in the lower part.</p></div> </div>
