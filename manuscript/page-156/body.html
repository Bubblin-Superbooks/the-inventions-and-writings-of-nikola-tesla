<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Suppose the twelve generator-coils P are wound alternately in opposite directions, so that any two adjacent coils of the same set tend to produce a free pole in the ring O between them and the twelve coils P' to be similarly wound. A single revolution of the disc or cylinder Q, the twelve polar projections of which are of opposite polarity, will therefore produce twelve current impulses in each of the circuits W W'. Hence the motor X, which has sixteen coils or eight free poles, will make one and a half turns to the generator's one. The motor Y, with twelve coils or six poles, will rotate with twice the speed of the generator, and the motor Z, with eight coils or four poles, will revolve three times as fast as the generator. These multipolar motors have a peculiarity which may be often utilized to great advantage. For example, in the motor X, Fig.</p></div> </div>
