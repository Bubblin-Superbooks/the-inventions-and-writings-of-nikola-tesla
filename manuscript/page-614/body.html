The discharge of this coil appears in the form of powerful brushes and luminous streams issuing from all points of the two straight wires attached to the terminals of the secondary.

What a difference there is between these phenomena! And yet, had I made the necessary arrangements&mdash;which could have been made easily, were it not that they would interfere with other experiments&mdash;I could have produced with this coil sparks which, had I the coil hidden from your view and only two knobs exposed, even the keenest observer among you would find it difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish from those of an influence or friction machine.</p></div> </div>
