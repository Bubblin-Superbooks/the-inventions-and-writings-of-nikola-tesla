A metal plate connected to the other terminal of the coil affects it at a great distance, slowing down the rotation often to one turn a second.</p><p>I am firmly convinced that such a brush, when we learn how to produce it properly, will prove a valuable aid in the investigation of the nature of the forces acting in an electrostatic or magnetic field. If there is any motion which is measurable going on in the space, such a brush ought to reveal it. It is, so to speak, a beam of light, frictionless, devoid of inertia.</p></div> </div>
