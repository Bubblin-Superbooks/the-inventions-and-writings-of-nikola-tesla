<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A few years later Mr. Tesla turned his attention again to the same subject, as, perhaps, was very natural in view of the fact that the commutator had always been prominent in his thoughts, and that so much of his work was even aimed at dispensing with it entirely as an objectionable and unnecessary part of dynamos and motors. In these later efforts to remedy commutator troubles, Mr. Tesla constructs a commutator and the collectors therefor in two parts mutually adapted to one another, and, so far as the essential features are concerned, alike in mechanical structure. Selecting as an illustration a commutator of two segments adapted for use with an armature the coils or coil of which have but two free ends, connected respectively to the segments, the bearing-surface is the face of a disc, and is formed of two metallic quadrant segments and two insulating segments of the same dimensions, and the face of the disc is smoothed off, so that the metal and insulating segments are flush.</p></div> </div>
