<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There are several known devices for giving motion in proportion to an electric current. In Figs. 256 and 257 the moving cores are shown as convenient devices for obtaining the required extent of motion with very slight changes in the current passing through the helices. It is understood that the adjustment of the main brushes causes variations in the strength of the current independently of the relative position of those brushes to the auxiliary brush. In all cases the adjustment should be such that no current flows over the auxiliary brush when the dynamo is running with its normal load.</p><p>In Figs. 256 and 257 A A indicate the main-brush holder, carrying the main brushes, and C the auxiliary-brush holder, carrying the auxiliary brush. These brush-holders are movable in arcs concentric with the centre of the commutator-shaft. An iron piston, P, of the solenoid S, Fig.</p></div> </div>
