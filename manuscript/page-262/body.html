<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now, assuming that an impulse or alternation in circuit or branch E is just beginning, while in the branch D it is just falling from maximum, the conditions are those of a quarter-phase difference. The ideal resultant of the attractive forces of the two sets of poles B C therefore may be considered as progressing from poles B to poles C, while the impulse in E is rising to maximum, and that in D is falling to zero or minimum. The polarity set up in the armature, however, lags behind the manifestations of field magnetism, and hence the maximum points of attraction in armature and field, instead of coinciding, are angularly displaced. This effect is counteracted by the supplemental poles B' C'. The magnetic phases of these poles succeed those of poles B C by the same, or nearly the same, period of time as elapses between the effect of the poles B C and the corresponding induced effect in the armature;</p></div> </div>
