When the plate is connected, the glow disappears. With a smaller plate it would not entirely disappear and then it would contribute to the brightness of the filament when the secondary is closed, by warming the air in the bulb.</p><p>. &nbsp; &nbsp; Fig. 178b.</p><p>. &nbsp; &nbsp; Fig. 179b.</p><p>To demonstrate another interesting feature, I have adjusted the coils used in a certain way. I first connect both the terminals of the lamp to the secondary, one end of the primary being connected to the terminal T1 of the induction coil and the other to the insulated plate P1 as before. When the current is turned on, the lamp glows brightly, as shown in Fig. 178b, in which C is a fine wire coil and S a coarse wire secondary wound upon it.</p></div> </div>
