<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Such objections will lose much weight if I connect the lamps in series, with the same result. When this is done and the discharges are directed through the filaments, it is again noted that the filament in the non-exhausted bulb l1, remains dark, while that in the exhausted one (l) glows even more intensely than under its normal conditions of working, Fig. 186b. According to general ideas the current through the filaments should now be the same, were it not modified by the presence of the gas around the filaments.</p><p>At this juncture I may point out another interesting feature, which illustrates the effect of the rate of change of potential of the currents. I will leave the two lamps connected in series to the bars B B1, as in the previous experiment, Fig. 186b, but will presently reduce considerably the frequency of the currents, which was excessive in the experiment just before shown.</p></div> </div>
