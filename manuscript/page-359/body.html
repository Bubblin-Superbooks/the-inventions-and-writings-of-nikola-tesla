<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Fig. 94.</p><p>The device is provided with suitable binding posts, to which the ends of the coils are led. The diametrically opposite coils B B and B' B' are connected, respectively, in series, and the four terminals are connected to the binding posts. The induced coils are connected together in any desired manner. For example, as shown in Fig. 94, C C may be connected in multiple arc when a quantity current is desired&mdash;as for running a group of incandescent lamps&mdash;while C' C' may be independently connected in series in a circuit including arc lamps or the like. The generator in this system will be adapted to the converter in the manner illustrated. For example, in the present case there are employed a pair of ordinary permanent or electro-magnets, E E, between which is mounted a cylindrical armature on a shaft, F, and wound with two coils, G G'.</p></div> </div>
