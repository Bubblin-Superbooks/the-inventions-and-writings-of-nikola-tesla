<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In each of these branches is placed an electrical generator, which for the present we will assume produces direct or continuous currents. The direction of the current thus produced is opposite in one branch to that of the current in the other branch, or, considering the two branches as forming a closed circuit, the generators E F are connected up in series therein, one generator in each part or half of the circuit. The electromotive force of the current sources E and F may be equal to or higher or lower than the electromotive forces in the branches C D, or between the points X and Y of the circuit B B. If equal, it is evident that current waves of one sign will be opposed in one branch and assisted in the other to such an extent that all the waves of one sign will pass over one branch and those of opposite sign over the other.</p></div> </div>
