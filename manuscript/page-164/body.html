<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It results from this that the operation of the exciter produces a progressive movement of the magnetic poles of the annular field-core of the generator, the shifting or rotary movement of the poles being synchronous with the rotation of the exciter armature. Considering the operative conditions of a system thus established, it will be found that when the exciter is driven so as to energize the field of the generator, the armature of the latter, if left free to turn, would rotate at a speed practically the same as that of the exciter. If under such conditions the coils F F' of the generator armature be closed upon themselves or short-circuited, no currents, at least theoretically, will be generated in these armature coils. In practice the presence of slight currents is observed, the existence of which is attributable to more or less pronounced fluctuations in the intensity of the magnetic poles of the generator ring.</p></div> </div>
