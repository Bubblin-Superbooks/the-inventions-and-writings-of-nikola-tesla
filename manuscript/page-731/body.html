<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The button was heated to the point of fusion, and when it melted, it did not, apparently, glow with the same brilliancy as before, and this would indicate a lower temperature. Leaving out of consideration the observer's possible, and even probable, error, the question is, can a body under these conditions be brought from a solid to a liquid state with the evolution of less light?</p><p>When the potential of a body is rapidly alternated, it is certain that the structure is jarred. When the potential is very high, although the vibrations may be few&mdash;say 20,000 per second&mdash;the effect upon the structure may be considerable. Suppose, for example, that a ruby is melted into a drop by a steady application of energy. When it forms a drop, it will emit visible and invisible waves, which will be in a definite ratio, and to the eye the drop will appear to be of a certain brilliancy.</p></div> </div>
