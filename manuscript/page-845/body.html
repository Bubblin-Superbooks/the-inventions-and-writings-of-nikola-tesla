<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I think that in lightning discharges frequently wires or conducting objects are volatilized merely because air is present, and that, were the conductor immersed in an insulating liquid, it would be safe, for then the energy would have to spend itself somewhere else. From the behavior of gases under sudden impulses of high potential, I am led to conclude that there can be no surer way of diverting a lightning discharge than by affording it a passage through a volume of gas, if such a thing can be done in a practical manner.</p><p>There are two more features upon which I think it necessary to dwell in connection with these experiments&mdash;the "radiant state" and the "non-striking vacuum."</p></div> </div>
