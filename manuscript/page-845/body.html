<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Such considerations apply even more to the production of light by the incandescence of a gas, or by phosphorescence. In all cases we require high frequencies and high potentials. These thoughts occurred to me a long time ago.</p><p>Incidentally we gain, by the use of high frequencies, many advantages, such as higher economy in the light production, the possibility of working with one lead, the possibility of doing away with the leading-in wire, etc.</p><p>The question is, how far can we go with frequencies? Ordinary conductors rapidly lose the facility of transmitting electric impulses when the frequency is greatly increased. Assume the means for the production of impulses of very great frequency brought to the utmost perfection, every one will naturally ask how to transmit them when the necessity arises. In transmitting such impulses through conductors we must remember that we have to deal with pressure and flow, in the ordinary interpretation of these terms.</p></div> </div>
