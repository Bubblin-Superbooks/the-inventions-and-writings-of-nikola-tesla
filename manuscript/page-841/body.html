<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A small stem s1 is provided with a needle, on the point of which is arranged, to rotate very freely, a very light fan of mica v. To prevent the fan from falling out, a thin stem of glass g, is bent properly and fastened to the aluminum tube. When the glass tube is held anywhere in the electrostatic field the platinum wire becomes incandescent, and the mica vanes are rotated very fast.</p><p>Intense phosphorescence may be excited in a bulb by merely connecting it to a plate within the field, and the plate need not be any larger than an ordinary lamp shade. The phosphorescence excited with these currents is incomparably more powerful than with ordinary apparatus. A small phosphorescent bulb, when attached to a wire connected to a coil, emits sufficient light to allow reading ordinary print at a distance of five to six paces.</p></div> </div>
