<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the form indicated in Fig. 253 the regulation is effected by shifting the point of greatest magnetism, and in Figs. 254 and 255 the same effect is produced by the action of the current in the shunt passing through the neutralizing helix.</p><p>The relative positions of the respective brushes may be varied by moving the auxiliary brush, or the brush c may remain stationary and the core P be connected to the main-brush holder A, so as to adjust the brushes a b in their relation to the brush c. If, however, an adjustment is applied to all the brushes, as seen in Fig. 257, the solenoid should be connected to both a and c, so as to move them toward or away from each other.</p></div> </div>
